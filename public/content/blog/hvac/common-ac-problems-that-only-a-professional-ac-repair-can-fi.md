No one wants to be stuck with a broken air conditioner, especially during the hot summer months. Unfortunately, AC repairs are sometimes necessary. Repairing air conditioners can be expensive, so it’s important to know what common problems can only be fixed by an AC repair done by a professional.

### When to Call the AC Repair Experts

Air conditioning systems require regular maintenance to function properly and avoid costly repairs. AC repair is best left to the professionals, because they have the training and experience to properly fix AC units.

Here are the common [AC repair](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/) problems that you should leave to the experts:

*   **Leaking Refrigerant:** If your air conditioner is leaking refrigerant, it will not be able to cool your home properly. This is a major problem that needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
*   **Frozen Coils:** Frozen coils are another common problem that is caused by refrigerant leaks. Once the coils freeze, your air conditioner will not be able to produce cold air.
*   **Compressor Issues:** If your air conditioner’s compressor is not working properly, it will not be able to circulate the refrigerant properly. This can lead to a number of problems, including leaks and frozen coils.
*   **Air Handler Problems:** The air handler is responsible for circulating the air in your home. If it is not working properly, then your AC unit will not be able to cool your home effectively.
*   **Clogged or Dirty Filters:** Clogged filters can cause a variety of problems, including reduced airflow and decreased efficiency. If you notice that your air conditioner’s filters are clogged, be sure to call an AC repair professional.
*   **Blower Motor Not Working:** The blower motor is usually the first thing to go on an AC unit. If your blower motor is not working, then your air conditioner will not be able to circulate the air, because the blades will not be moving.

Other things to look out for that call for an [AC repair specialist](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/):

*   **Not Blowing Cold Air:** If your central air conditioner is not blowing cold air, there could be a problem with the compressor. It is also possible that the refrigerant is low. Hot air could also be a sign of poor insulation. Freon can be dangerous, so it’s best to leave this repair to the experts.
*   **Water Leaking:** If you notice water leakage from your AC unit,it could be a sign of a clogged drain line. An AC repair specialist will be able to clear the clog and prevent future leaks.
*   **Strange Noises:** If you notice that your AC unit is starting to make strange noises, it could be a sign of a loose component. An AC repair specialist will be able to tighten any loose components and silence the noise.
*   **Dirty Condenser Coil:** The condenser coil is responsible for dissipating heat, so if it’s dirty, it won’t be able to do its job properly. An AC repair specialist will be able to clean the coil and restore your unit’s cooling power.

Air conditioners are complex machines, and many problems can only be fixed by a trained professional. If you’re having AC trouble, be sure to call the leading expert in Tucson, AZ – [Intelligent Design](https://www.idesignac.com/)!

### Common Problems That Have an Easy Fix

Check to see if the problem is something that you can fix yourself. Here are a few common problems that don’t require professional help:

*   **Thermostat Not Working:** The thermostat is responsible for turning the AC unit on and off. If it’s not working properly, your AC unit will either run all the time or not at all. Try replacing the batteries in the thermostat.
*   **Unit Not Turning On:** If your AC unit is not turning on, it could be because the breaker has been tripped. Reset the breaker and see if that fixes the problem. If not, you may need to call an AC repair technician.
*   **Unit Not Cooling the House:** If the unit is running but not cooling the house, there could be a problem with the airflow. Check to see if the vents are open. If they are, check to see if the filter is dirty. A dirty filter can restrict airflow and cause the AC unit to work harder than it needs to. Simply replacing the filter can often fix this problem.

As you can see, there are a few things that you can check before calling an AC repair technician. However, if the problem is something more serious, then it’s time to call Intelligent Design! We are willing to give you a free repair estimate!

### Avoiding Costly AC Repairs

Repairing AC systems can be expensive, so it’s important to do everything you can to avoid costly repairs. Replacement parts and labor can add up quickly, so it’s best to take preventive measures to avoid AC problems.

Here are a few tips to keep AC repair costs at a minimum:

*   **Change the Filter Regularly:** A dirty filter can restrict airflow and cause the unit to overwork itself. Replacing the filter every month or two can help prevent this problem.
*   **Keep the Area Clear:** The AC unit needs adequate airflow to function properly. Keeping the area around the unit clear of debris and vegetation can help ensure that it has the airflow it needs.
*   **Schedule Regular Maintenance:** One of the best ways to avoid costly AC repairs is to schedule regular maintenance. During a maintenance visit, an HVAC technician will clean the unit, check for any potential problems, and make any necessary repairs.
*   **Keep an Eye on the Thermostat:** The thermostat is responsible for turning the AC unit on and off. If it’s not working properly, then your AC unit will either run all the time or not at all. Checking the thermostat regularly can help you to spot any potential problems before they become serious.

### AC Repair Specialist: What You Should Look for

Summer is here, and so is the heat! With the heat comes the need for air conditioner repair. Your best friend during the hot months is a reliable AC repair specialist. Here are some tips on what you should look for when choosing an AC repair specialist:

1.  **Reliability**

You want to make sure your AC repair specialist is reliable. This means that they will show up on time and be able to get the job done in a timely manner. You don’t want to be without an air conditioning system for days on end, so it’s important to find someone who can come out and take care of the problem quickly.

3.  **Communication**

Another important aspect to look for is communication. You want to make sure that your AC specialist is able to communicate with you about what the problem is and how they plan on fixing it. This way, you can be sure that the repairs are being made in a way that will actually solve the problem.

5.  **Affordability**

Last but not least, you want to find an AC specialist that is affordable. This doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice quality, but you don’t want to spend an arm and a leg on repairs either. Be sure to get quotes from multiple specialists before making a decision.

These are just a few things to keep in mind when choosing an AC specialist. With these tips, you can be sure that you’ll find someone who can help you stay cool all summer long!
