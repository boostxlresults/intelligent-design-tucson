Have you been sneezing more around the house? Dry throat, headaches, weird tiredness? Instead of pointing fingers at the weather or seasonal allergies, look to your AC Unit, particularly its filter. A dirty filter will not only lessen the efficiency of the unit itself but also potentially compromise your health.

_This article will show you the health benefits of maintaining your air conditioning unit and why proper_ [**_air conditioning service in Tucson_**](https://www.idesignac.com/) _will leave you with a cleaner home and a healthier life._

## The Health Hazards of Dirty AC Filters

Filters trap pollutants, allergens, dust mites, bacteria, mold spores, and pet dander before these contaminants are released into your home. Once your filter is plugged up, it can no longer trap contaminants. Following that, there can be a cascade of unwanted consequences, such as:

### • Respiratory Issues

Dirty filters can lead to the development of asthma, bronchitis, and sinus infections. All this may have greater implications for children and elderly individuals.

### • Allergy Symptoms

Trapped dust mites, pollen, and mold can increase your chances of experiencing frequent and uncontrollable sneezing, watery eyes, or irritated skin.

### • Compromised Immunity

Due to the poor air quality in your home, you are placing more stress on your immune system, which will raise your risk of developing illness for several years.

### • Fatigue and Headaches

When your body works harder to breathe fresh air, it can lead to chronic fatigue. Chronic exposure to dirty indoor air may also lead to headaches.

## Clean Filters = Clean Air = Healthy Living
