In Southern Arizona, central air conditioning is a must-have for comfortably surviving summer. If your AC breaks down, one of the first things you’ll wonder is: “What does a new air conditioner cost?” There is no question that a brand new central air conditioner will be quite an investment. After all, these are powerful machines capable of transforming the dry, scorching desert air into pleasant, livable conditions. However, it simply isn’t feasible to give an estimate for a new AC unit over the phone. This is because there are so many factors that go into designing a new system. Here is a look at a few of the factors that determine air conditioner cost.

### Understanding the Variations in Air Conditioner Cost Estimates

Consumers are often puzzled as to why different central AC units are priced so dramatically different. It’s because there are dramatic differences in the equipment itself as well as the installation. As with most things in life, you’ll get what you pay for. It’s much like buying a car. You could buy a used rust bucket for a few thousand dollars, but don’t expect it to last too long. Or, you could go to a respectable dealership and spend more to get a better car that will last for years.

Just like buying a car, the new air conditioner cost estimate will depend on the make, model, and features of the equipment. During your free AC replacement estimate with Intelligent Design Air Conditioning and Heating, you can talk with the technician about your budget, and he or she can help you choose equipment and installation options that work best for you. Bear in mind, however, that it’s often worth it to spend a bit more to get a durable, reliable system that will keep your family comfortable for years to come.

### Exploring the Factors that Influence Air Conditioner Cost Estimates

When you receive the estimate for your new system, the technician can break down the different costs for you. Generally, you can expect the average estimate to start around $5,000 and go up depending on the equipment and its installation. For example, if you choose a new AC unit with a high SEER rating, you can expect to pay more. Better quality equipment will always cost more than low-quality units.

Another factor that influences the cost is the size of your home. Larger homes will require a central AC unit with a larger capacity. The age of your home may also play a role. If you have an older home with insufficient ductwork, you may need to have the ductwork extended or repaired—unless you decide to choose a ductless mini split system.

### Evaluating Options for Long-Term Savings

Even if you understand that you’ll need to spend more to get a better system, you’ll undoubtedly want to cut costs wherever possible. With replacement air conditioner cost estimates, it’s often a smart strategy to look for long-term savings. That is, if you spend more to get a central AC with a high SEER rating, you’ll save more in the long run because you won’t pay as much for electricity.

Another possibility is to talk with the technician about investing in a solar-powered AC unit—now available from Intelligent Design in Tucson! A solar-powered AC is exactly what it sounds like. It transforms free sunlight into the energy needed to power your air conditioner and keep your family comfortable. The SunTrac hybrid climate system works with any type of AC system, including mini splits, central, and multi-split systems! Although the upfront investment will be higher, you’ll reap the rewards with lower utility bills for years to come.

A third way to manage your long-term air conditioning costs is to talk to the technician about service agreements. A service agreement allows you to save money on the cost of maintenance and repairs. Even brand new systems need to be maintained regularly or they suffer from reduced efficiency. This, of course, leads to higher utility bills. So if you’re looking for ways to lower the total cost of air conditioning in Southern Arizona, signing up for a service agreement and scheduling regular maintenance visits is definitely a smart strategy.

Although it isn’t possible to give a quote for a new air conditioner cost over the phone, you can get a free, custom-designed quote for your new system when you meet with a certified technician from Intelligent Design. Our technicians will measure your living space, discuss your options and preferences, and develop an accurate estimate free of charge. Would you like to learn more?
