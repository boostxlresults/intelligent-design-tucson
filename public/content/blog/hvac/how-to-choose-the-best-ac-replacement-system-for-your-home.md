Summer means it’s time to start thinking about AC replacement! If your current system is on its last legs, or if you’re looking for an upgrade, it can be tough to decide which system is best for your home. There are a lot of different options out there, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you.

In this post, we will discuss the important factors you need to consider when making your decision, and by the end, you’ll know exactly which AC replacement system is best for your home!

### Types of Air Conditioning Systems

There are several different types of air conditioning systems to choose from. Four types of systems are common in residential homes:

*   Central air conditioners
*   Ductless mini-split air conditioners
*   Portable air conditioners
*   Window air conditioners

Each type of system has its own unique set of pros and cons. We’ll go over each type of system in detail so you can decide which one is right for you.

### Central Air Conditioners

Central air conditioners are the most common type of AC system. They use a central unit to cool your entire home. The unit is usually located in the attic, basement, or garage. For those looking for the most efficient cooling, central air conditioners are the way to go.

Cool air is distributed evenly throughout your home via a system of ducts. These ducts are usually located in the ceilings, floors, or walls. Central air conditioners are generally more expensive to install than other types of AC systems, but they are also the most energy-efficient option.

### Pros:

Most Efficient – Central air cooling systems are very efficient. In fact, they can save you up to 30% on your energy bill each month.

Durable – A central AC system can last up to 20 years with proper maintenance.

Quiet – Central air conditioners have sound-dampening features that make them much quieter than other types of AC systems.

Comfort – A central air conditioner can cool your entire home to the same temperature. This is perfect for people who have allergies or sensitivities to temperature changes.

### Cons:

Initial Cost – Central air conditioners are typically more expensive to install than other types of AC systems.

Ductwork – You need to have ductwork installed in your home for a central air conditioner to work. This can be expensive and time-consuming.

Maintenance – Central air conditioners require regular maintenance to keep them running properly.

### Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners

Ductless mini-split air conditioners are a newer type of AC system. They have many of the same advantages as central air conditioners, but they don’t require ductwork. Ductless mini-splits consist of an outdoor unit that is connected to one or more indoor units via a small conduit. The outdoor unit pumps refrigerant to the indoor units, distributing cool air throughout your home.

Ductless units are considered the most energy-efficient type of air conditioner. They are also very quiet and can be used to cool individual rooms or areas.

### Pros:

No Ductwork Needed – Ductless mini-split AC systems don’t require any ductwork, making them much easier to install than central air conditioners.

Very Efficient – Ductless mini-splits are extremely efficient, saving you up to 30% on your energy bill each month.

Flexible – Ductless mini-splits can be used to cool individual rooms or areas. This makes them perfect for homes with irregular layouts.

Quiet – Ductless AC units are very quiet, making them perfect for bedrooms and other areas where you don’t want a lot of noise.

Dual Use – Some ductless AC units can be used for both heating and cooling. This makes them a great all-season option.

### Cons:

Expensive – Ductless mini-splits are more expensive than other types of air conditioners.

Installation – Ductless mini-splits require professional installation, which can add to the overall cost.

Wall-Mounted – Ductless mini-splits are wall-mounted, which may not be ideal if you have limited space.

### Portable Air Conditioners

Portable air conditioners are a good option for those who want the flexibility to move their AC unit. Portable AC units can be placed on wheels and rolled from one room to another. They are also small enough to fit through doorways and windows.

### Pros:

Flexible – Portable air conditioners can be moved from one room to another, making them very versatile.  
Inexpensive – Portable air conditioners are typically less expensive than other types of air conditioners.  
Easy to Install – Portable AC units can be set up quickly and easily.

### Cons:

Less Efficient – Portable air conditioners are not as energy-efficient as other types of air conditioners.

Noisy – Portable air conditioners can be quite noisy, making them less ideal for bedrooms and other quiet areas.

Temporary – A portable air conditioner is not the best option if you want a permanent solution.

### Window Air Conditioners

The cooling system of a window air conditioner is very similar to that of a central air conditioner. The unit has an evaporator coil, which absorbs heat from the air in your home. The refrigerant in the coil then evaporates, creating cool air. The compressor circulates the refrigerant through the coils, providing continuous cooling.

Window air conditioners are a good option for those who want to cool a single room or area. Window AC units can be installed quickly and easily. They are also less expensive than other types of air conditioners.

### Pros:

Inexpensive – These units are typically less expensive than other types of air conditioners.

Easy to Install – Window AC units can be installed quickly and easily.

Efficient – As long as they are the right size for the room, window air conditioners can be quite efficient.

### Cons:

Temporary – If you move, you’ll need to remove the AC unit and reinstall it in your new home.

Can Be Loud – Window air conditioners can be quite noisy, making them less ideal for bedrooms and other quiet areas.

Block Views – Window air conditioners can block your view if installed in a window you look out of often.

Not Comprehensive – Window air conditioners only cool the area immediately around them. They are not able to cool an entire home as a central air conditioner can.

Environmental Factors – If you live in an area with high humidity, a window air conditioner may not be the best option, as it can cause condensation and moisture build-up.

### Factors to Consider When Choosing an AC Replacement System

Now that you know the different air conditioning system options available to you, it’s time to start considering which one is right for your home. There are a few factors you’ll need to take into account in order to make the best decision.

**Size of your home –** Air conditioning replacement systems come in various sizes. You’ll need to make sure you choose a large enough system to cool your entire home.

**The layout of your home –** The layout of your home can affect the type of HVAC system you need. A ductless mini-split might be your best option if you have a smaller home or an irregular layout.

**Your energy costs –** One of the main reasons people replace their air conditioning system is to save on energy costs. If your current system is outdated, it might be costing you more than you think. Consider how much you could save by switching to a newer, more efficient model.

**The climate in your area –** The climate in your area will dictate what type of air conditioner replacement system you need. If you live in a hotter climate, you’ll need a more powerful system to keep your home cool.

**Your budget –** Of course, your budget is another important factor to consider when choosing an AC replacement system. Talk to your HVAC contractor about financing options if you need help paying for your new system.

Now that you know what to look for, it’s time to start shopping for a new system. Be sure to compare different models and brands before making your final decision. Don’t forget to read online reviews to see what other people are saying about the different air conditioners on the market. With a little research, you should be able to find the perfect air conditioner for your home.
