Having air conditioning problems can be a stressful experience, especially in the summer months. Knowing when you should try to tackle the repair yourself and when it’s time to call in an expert is an important part of ensuring that your AC system stays in good condition.

In this article, we’ll look at some of the factors to consider when deciding whether you should attempt a DIY repair or call in an expert.

## Understand the Basics of Air Conditioning Repair

[Air conditioning repair](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-repair-tucson/) is the process of repairing and maintaining a cooling system, typically in a home or commercial setting. This type of repair involves diagnosing issues, troubleshooting problems, and making repairs to ensure proper operation.

The components of an air conditioning system can include an evaporator coil, condenser fan motor, compressor, thermostat, and other related components. To understand the basics of air conditioning repair, it is important to know the different components that make up a system and how they work together. Here is a quick overview of each component:

*   **Evaporator coil** – This is responsible for cooling the air that passes through it. The evaporator coil helps to cool the air by absorbing heat from the interior and releasing it outside.
*   **Condenser fan motor** – The HVAC system has a fan motor that is responsible for circulating cool air. The condenser fan motor helps to keep the system running smoothly and efficiently by ensuring that the proper amount of airflow is maintained inside the home.
*   **Compressor** – Central air conditioning systems use a compressor to pressurize the refrigerant and move it through the system. The compressor is responsible for controlling how much air is pushed through the system, which in turn controls the temperature of your home.
*   **Thermostat** – An AC unit thermostat is responsible for regulating the system’s temperature and controlling the fan motor. The thermostat’s settings tell the air conditioner when to turn it on, how long it needs to run, and how much energy it should use.

By understanding these basic components of an air conditioning system, you can better determine when it is best to DIY or when it may be smarter to call in a professional. Knowing these components can help you identify any issues and decide if it is a job you can take on yourself or one that should be left to the experts.

### When to Call an A/C Professional

If you’re considering a DIY repair for your air conditioner, it’s important to know when to call in the professionals. Here are a few signs that you should contact an A/C professional:

**High electric bills**

Air conditioners are known to be one of the top causes of high electric bills, so homeowners need to keep an eye on their AC units and make sure that they remain in good condition. If your air conditioning unit is put under a lot of strain or running inefficiently, it can cause your energy bills to skyrocket.

If you notice this happening, then you may need to look into getting a professional AC repair. The air conditioner repair company can ensure that your air conditioner is running properly and not costing you too much money in energy bills.

**Major (or hidden) leaks**

If you suspect a major (or hidden) leak, it is usually best to call an AC repair service. Not only can it be difficult for the average homeowner to identify the source of the leak but attempting to fix major AC leaks can cause further damage if done improperly.

Additionally, even if you manage to locate the source of the leak and make a temporary fix, it may not be enough to keep your AC running efficiently or prevent further damage in the future. Our local HVAC contractors can provide a [FREE DIAGNOSTIC WITH REPAIR](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/) and help you determine the most cost-effective solution to keep your AC running safely and efficiently.

**Mold growth**

The indoor temperature and humidity of your home impact your air conditioner’s performance. If you are noticing dampness and mold growth around your AC unit, it may require professional attention. Mold growth is not only unsightly, but it can also be hazardous to health.

A qualified repair specialist can inspect the area for mold and recommend an appropriate course of action. They can also check to ensure that your AC unit is operating at peak efficiency and make any necessary repairs or adjustments. Your service call may include cleaning the evaporator coils and replacing any filters that have been clogged with dirt or debris.

**Foul smells**

If you are noticing an unusual smell coming from your AC unit, it is a sign that professional attention is needed. This could be due to a variety of issues such as mold, mildew, or another problem in the system.

If you try to investigate the cause on your own, you risk exposing yourself to unhealthy air quality or greater damage being caused by attempting to repair something that you are not experienced with handling.

**Loud/scary noises**

Air handler fans, compressors, and blower motors can be expected to make a certain amount of noise. If you notice any unusually loud or scary noises coming from your air conditioning system, it’s time to call in the pros. These types of sounds may indicate that one of these components is having an issue that requires specialized attention.

No matter the cause, it’s important to get your AC unit checked out and repaired as quickly as possible to prevent further damage or an even higher electric bill. Professional technicians have the tools, knowledge, and expertise needed to diagnose any problem and provide a lasting solution. Contact us today to schedule an appointment.

### What Repairs Can You DIY?

AC repairs that can be done by the average homeowner include cleaning/changing air filters, checking and replacing fuses, resetting circuit breakers, and inspecting insulation. In addition to these small tasks, you can also inspect your AC unit for any visible signs of wear and tear such as cracked fan blades or leaking hoses.

If you’re comfortable with tinkering, you can also attempt to replace the fan motor or capacitor if necessary. However, these types of projects can be quite complex and may require more than just basic knowledge and skillset. If you’re uncertain about any repairs, it is best to call a professional for help.
