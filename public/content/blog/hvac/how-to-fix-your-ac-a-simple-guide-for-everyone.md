TUCSON, AZ – June 10, 2024 – Intelligent Design Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Solar, & Electric is excited to share an easy-to-understand guide about fixing air conditioners (AC). This guide helps people learn about common AC problems, why fixing them quickly is important, and how [professional AC repair](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/) can make homes more comfortable and save money on energy bills.

## **Why Fixing Your AC Quickly Is Important**

Air conditioners keep homes cool and comfortable, especially when it’s really hot outside. Fixing problems with your AC right away is important because:

1.  **Stopping More Damage:** Small problems can become big, expensive problems if they aren’t fixed quickly.
2.  **Saving Energy:** An AC that works well uses less energy, which can lower your electric bills.
3.  **Staying Comfortable:** Fixing your AC helps keep your home cool and comfortable, even on the hottest days.
4.  **Making Your AC Last Longer:** Regular maintenance and quick repairs help your AC last longer, so you won’t need to buy a new one as soon.

### **Common AC Problems and How to Fix Them**

There are many things that can go wrong with an AC. Knowing about these problems can help you understand when it’s time to call a professional for AC repair.

1.  **Refrigerant Leaks:** If your AC isn’t cooling well, it might need more refrigerant. A professional can find and fix leaks and add more refrigerant.
2.  **Dirty Air Filters:** If air filters are dirty, they can block airflow and make the AC work harder. Cleaning or replacing filters regularly helps the AC run better.
3.  **Thermostat Problems:** If the AC keeps turning on and off or isn’t keeping the right temperature, the thermostat might need to be fixed or replaced.
4.  **Frozen Coils:** Coils can freeze if there’s not enough airflow or if refrigerant is low. A professional can clean the coils and check the refrigerant.
5.  **Electrical Issues:** Problems with wiring or electrical parts can cause the AC to stop working. A qualified technician can safely fix these issues.
6.  **Clogged Drains:** If water is leaking from the AC, the drain might be clogged. Cleaning the drain can fix this problem.
7.  **Compressor Issues:** The compressor is a key part of the AC. If it breaks, the whole system might not work. A professional can diagnose and fix compressor problems.

### **Why Professional AC Repair Is Important**

Getting professional help for AC repair is important for several reasons:

1.  **Correct Diagnosis:** Professionals know how to find out what’s wrong with your AC and how to fix it correctly.
2.  **Quality Repairs:** Professionals use good-quality parts and follow standards to make sure repairs last.
3.  **Safety:** Fixing an AC involves working with electricity and chemicals. Professionals have the training to do this safely.
4.  **Maintaining Warranties:** Many AC warranties require professional maintenance and repairs to stay valid.

Andrew Dobbins, owner of Intelligent Design Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Solar, & Electric, says, “Getting professional help to fix your AC is really important. Professionals make sure your AC is fixed right, works well, and keeps you comfortable,” said Dobbins.

### **Regular Maintenance for Better Performance**

Regular maintenance helps keep your AC running smoothly. Here are some important maintenance tasks:

1.  **Cleaning Components:** Regularly clean parts like coils, filters, and drain lines to keep them free from dirt and debris.
2.  **Checking Refrigerant Levels:** Make sure the AC has the right amount of refrigerant. Low levels can mean there’s a leak that needs fixing.
3.  **Lubricating Moving Parts:** Adding oil to moving parts helps them work better and last longer.
4.  **Tightening Electrical Connections:** Loose connections can cause problems. Tightening them ensures the AC works safely and efficiently.
5.  **Testing the Thermostat:** Make sure the thermostat is set and working correctly to keep the house at the right temperature.
6.  **Inspecting Ductwork:** Check for [leaks or damage in the ducts](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/duct-services/) to improve airflow and efficiency.

### **Energy-Saving Tips and Upgrades**

Besides fixing and maintaining the AC, there are other ways to make it work better and save energy:

1.  **Smart Thermostats:** These devices let you control the temperature from your phone and can help save energy.
2.  **High-Efficiency Filters:** Better filters [improve air quality](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/improve-indoor-air-quality-tucson/) and help the AC work more efficiently.
3.  **Zoning Systems:** These systems let you cool different parts of the house separately, saving energy and keeping everyone comfortable.
4.  **Variable Speed Motors:** Motors that adjust their speed can keep the temperature steady and save energy.
5.  **Insulation and Sealing:** Proper insulation and sealing keep the cool air in and the hot air out, making the AC work less.
6.  **Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs):** ERVs bring in fresh air while keeping the cool air inside, improving air quality and saving energy.
