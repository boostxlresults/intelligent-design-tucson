The summer heat is bearing down on us, and if you’re like most people, you’re probably cranking up the AC to stay cool. But did you know that all that extra use can damage your air conditioning unit?

In this post, we will discuss some tips on how to prevent your AC from breaking down under the strain of summer heat. Follow these simple tips, and you’ll be able to keep your home with cool air all summer long.

### Understand How Your Air Conditioner Works

One of the most important things you can do is to understand how your air conditioner works. [Air conditioning works](https://www.idesignac.com/why-is-my-air-conditioning-working-upstairs-but-not-downstairs/) by removing heat from the air inside your home and transferring it outside. If you don’t understand how your unit works, it can be more difficult to troubleshoot problems when they occur.

There are many resources available online that explain how an AC unit works; you may also want to contact our team for more information.

### Change Your Filters Regularly

One way to keep your air conditioner running smoothly is by changing the filters regularly. The filter keeps dust and dirt from clogging up the system, which can cause it to work harder than necessary.

This is particularly important during the summer months because hot weather means more people are using their AC units all day long! In fact, some experts recommend changing your filter every month or two when running an air conditioner full time instead of just once every three months. You can find the filters for your AC unit at most hardware stores.

### Create Shade for the Outdoor Unit

Your AC unit relies on airflow to cool the air, and if that airflow is blocked it can cause the unit to overheat. One way to prevent this is by creating shade for the outdoor unit.

Paint or plant trees or shrubs near the unit to provide some natural shade; you can also install awnings or shades specifically designed for this purpose.

Another option is to build a privacy fence around the AC unit, which will provide shade and block dust from blowing onto it as well!

An outdoor cover is another good way to protect your air conditioner from excessive sun exposure during the summer.

### Keep the Area Around the Unit Clean

It’s essential to keep the area around your [AC unit clean](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/), as this will help with airflow and cooling. Make sure there is a clear path for air to flow in and out of the unit, and remove any debris or obstructions from around it.

You should also make sure that no leaves or other objects are blocking the intake or exhaust vents on the unit.

If you have a pet that likes to hang out around the AC unit, try to train them to stay away or create a designated area for them to hang out in instead.

Debris can also cause your AC unit to work harder and increase your energy bill, so keeping the area clean is important to save money!

### Cover Your Windows

If the sun is beating down on your windows, it can cause your AC unit to work harder and increase energy costs. You might consider installing window shades or blinds that block out some of this heat during hot days when you are using the air conditioner most often.

You should also check for any gaps in weatherstripping around your windows, as these can let in hot air and make it more difficult for the AC unit to cool down inside.

If you have older windows without weatherstripping, try adding some new strips of foam before installing window treatments like curtains or blinds.

### Use a Programmable Thermostat

A programmable thermostat can help you save energy and money by allowing you to set the temperature of your home at different times of the day.

For example, you can [set the thermostat to lower the temperature](https://www.idesignac.com/what-temperature-should-i-set-my-thermostat/) during the night or when you’re not home. This will help reduce strain on your AC unit and save you money on your energy bill.

You can also set the thermostat to turn on and off at certain times, which is a great way to ensure that your home is cool when you need it most.

There are a variety of programmable thermostats available on the market, so be sure to do your research before purchasing one!

### Install a Ceiling Fan

Ceiling fans can help circulate the air in your home, which can make it feel cooler. They also use less energy than an AC unit, so they can be a great alternative when temperatures are not too high.

Installing a ceiling fan is a relatively easy DIY project, and there are many different styles and sizes to choose from. Be sure to consult with a professional if you are unsure about which fan is best for your home.

### Regularly Service Your AC Unit

It’s a good idea to have your AC unit serviced by a professional at least once a year. This will help ensure that it is running efficiently and catch any potential problems before they become bigger issues.

A service technician can clean the unit, check for leaks, and replace filters as needed. They can also inspect the ductwork to make sure there are no obstructions or other issues that might cause your AC unit to work harder than necessary.

Additionally, have an HVAC professional [clean out the drain](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) line and check for any potential problems before they become bigger issues.
