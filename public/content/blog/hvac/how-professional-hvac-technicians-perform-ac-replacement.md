Are you in need of a new air conditioner? If your old AC unit is on its last leg, it might be time to call in the professionals for an AC replacement. Many people think they can replace their air conditioner on their own, but unless you’re a trained HVAC technician, it’s best to leave this job to the experts. Here’s a look at how these professionals perform air conditioner replacement.

## Why Leave It To Professionals?

Replacing an air conditioner is no small job. It requires knowledge and skill to ensure that the new unit is installed correctly and safely, which is why [professional HVAC technicians](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-installation-tucson/) should be called in.

These technicians have years of experience working with AC units and know how to remove old models, install new ones, and perform necessary maintenance or repairs. Aside from those benefits, some of the reasons why you should leave ac replacement to the professionals include:

*   Professional HVAC installers can guide the best AC unit for your space and needs.
*   They will ensure that your new AC system is installed correctly so everything runs smoothly.
*   They understand how to check for potential issues with the old unit.
*   Professional ac installers can access parts and tools that may not be available elsewhere. This means they can quickly repair or replace any parts needing attention during installation.

### The Actual Process Of Replacing An Air Conditioner

When it comes time to perform an air conditioner replacement, a professional HVAC technician is the one you should call. They will arrive at your home with the right tools and materials to complete the job. Here’s what you can expect during AC replacement:

**1\. Assess the Existing AC Unit**

The first step is to assess the existing air conditioner. The technician will check for any potential problems or issues that need to be addressed before the air conditioner replacement occurs. This includes checking for worn-out or faulty parts, blockages, and other signs of wear and tear that could affect the new AC unit’s performance.

You might wonder why they still need to assess the unit while it’s being replaced – it’s because ac replacement doesn’t mean the old unit is entirely out of the picture. Often, parts from an older ac system will be reused and repurposed for a newer model.

Sometimes the AC unit doesn’t need to be replaced but needs to be repaired. If the AC technician you hired is honest, they will let you know the best course of action.

**2\. Prepare the Area**

Once the AC technician has assessed the existing air cooling unit, they will begin preparing the area for a replacement. This includes removing anything that will obstruct the removal of the old AC unit and the installation of the new one. This could include furniture, flooring, wall hangings, and other items that could get in the way. This is to ensure that the replacement is safe and efficient.

**3\. Cut the Power**

The AC technician will then cut off the power to the air conditioning unit. This step prevents potential electrical accidents or hazards while replacing the air conditioning system. They will gain access to attics, basements, and other home areas to disconnect any power cords or wires connected to them.

**4\. Remove the Old Air Conditioner**

Once everything is disconnected and ready for a replacement, the technician will begin removing the old AC system. This includes disconnecting any associated wiring and other parts that need to be removed for the air conditioning unit to come out safely.

This may require special tools and equipment depending on how difficult it is to remove. They will take care not to damage anything while removing the AC unit, so you don’t have to worry about any costly repairs or replacements later on.

**5\. Install The New AC Unit**

Once the old air conditioning unit has been removed, it’s time to install the new air cooling system; depending on the type of AC, it can take some time to install the new AC system properly. If they were to install inside and outside units, the installation might take a few hours, as the technician may need to cut through walls to access the outside AC unit.

The components that may be installed during an HVAC installation include the inside air handler or evaporator, outdoor compressor or condensing unit, new refrigerant supply lines, thermostat, condensate drain lines, and the condensate pump (when applicable).

**6\. Test The New AC Unit**

Once everything has been installed, it’s time for the AC technician to test the new air conditioning system. This includes turning it on and letting it run for some time to ensure everything runs smoothly. They will also check for leaks or blockages before they finish up with the air conditioner installation so that your new AC system runs appropriately.

**7\. Finishing Up**

After ensuring everything is working correctly, the technician will do a few more tasks, such as:

*   Sealing the air conditioning unit
*   Ensures all wires and cables are properly connected
*   Cleaning up any mess they may have made during AC installation.
*   Show you how to use the new AC system and provide tips for maintenance.
*   Answer any questions or concerns you may have about your air conditioner replacement. With this, you’ll be able to enjoy a cool environment in no time!

### Common Mistakes DIYers And Unprofessional AC Installers Make

While replacing your air conditioning system can be done by an AC technician hired by you or a DIYer, it is important to note that certain mistakes might occur if the air conditioning unit isn’t correctly installed. These include:

*   Incorrectly connecting wires and cables, which can cause the ac unit to malfunction
*   Not sealing all the ac components properly can lead to air leaks
*   Installing ac units in areas with insufficient space for them to function properly.

If those mistakes are made, it can lead to issues including:

*   **Lead to lower efficiency of the AC unit** : If the installation is not done properly, it can lead to lower ac efficiency due to improper sealing or other factors that could cause air leakage.
*   \>Damage To Walls and floors : If AC units are not installed correctly, it can cause damage to walls and floors due to incorrect drilling or cutting during installation.
*   **Costly repairs later on** : If the installation is not done correctly, it can lead to costly repairs due to potential electrical hazards or system malfunctions.
