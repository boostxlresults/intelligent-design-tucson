It’s summertime in Tucson, which means one thing – air conditioning! Keeping your home cool during the hot desert months can be expensive, but it doesn’t have to be. As we all know, air conditioning is a lifesaver during hot days, and it can also save you from a hefty energy bill during the summer.

Did you know that you can save more? You can do plenty of things to reduce your energy bills and save money on air conditioning. Here are some tips on how you can use your air conditioning efficiently.

### 1\. Set the Temperature Properly

One of the most common mistakes people make is setting their air conditioner to a lower temperature than necessary. This not only wastes energy, but can also lead to higher energy bills.

The best way to save energy and money is to set your air conditioner to a comfortable temperature that you can maintain throughout the day. Set the temperature at 78 degrees or higher during the day and lower it to 68 degrees at night.

### 2\. Check the System Regularly

Your air conditioner needs to be checked and serviced regularly to ensure it runs efficiently. A well-maintained air conditioner will use less energy and last longer than one that is not maintained. Schedule a service appointment with a qualified technician at least once a year to ensure your air conditioner runs efficiently.

### 3\. Change the Filter

Air conditioners can build up dirt and dust over time, which can block airflow and reduce efficiency. Changing the air filter regularly is important to keep your air conditioner running efficiently. Depending on the type of air conditioner you have, you may need to change the air filter every month or two, or as often as the manufacturer recommends.

### 4\. Keep Air Vents Open

A common mistake people make is closing air vents in rooms that are not being used. This can cause your air conditioner to work harder and use more energy. To save energy, keep all air vents open and clear of obstructions.

### 5\. Use a Ceiling Fan

Many people think that keeping the fan and air conditioner on will make their energy bills go up. However, using a ceiling fan can actually help you save money on your air conditioning bill. Ceiling fans use less energy than air conditioners and can help circulate the air in your home, making it feel cooler. In addition, ceiling fans can help reduce your energy bills by up to 40 percent.

### 6\. Plant Shade Trees

One of the best ways to reduce air conditioning costs is to plant shade trees around your home. Shade trees can provide natural cooling for your home and help reduce the amount of heat that enters through windows and doors. In addition, planting trees can also help improve air quality and reduce noise pollution

### 7\. Cover Your Windows

Another way to reduce the heat entering your home is to cover your windows. There are a variety of window coverings available that can help keep your home cool, including blinds, shades, and curtains.

In addition, you can also purchase special window film that reflects heat away from your home. Doing this can help reduce your air conditioning costs by up to 30 percent.

### 8\. Install a Programmable Thermostat

One of the best ways to save money on air conditioning is to install a programmable thermostat. Programmable thermostats allow you to set different temperatures for different times of the day, so you’re not cooling your home when you’re not there.

In addition, programmable thermostats can also help you save money by reducing your energy usage during peak hours. However, proper installation is critical to ensure that your programmable thermostat works correctly. Hire a qualified professional to install your programmable thermostat.

### 9\. Turn Off the Air Conditioning When Leaving the House

Remember to turn off your air conditioner when you leave the house. This will help you save energy and money and extend your air conditioner’s life.

When you’re ready to cool down, turn on your air conditioner a few minutes before arriving home. By following these simple tips, you can save money on your air conditioning bill and keep your home cool and comfortable all summer long.

### 10\. Choose an AC That Fits Your Home

When choosing a new air conditioner, select one that is the right size for your home. An air conditioner that is too small or too large will not work efficiently and can cost you more money in the long run. To find the right air conditioner for your home, consult a qualified HVAC contractor to help you select an air conditioner that is the right size.

### 11\. Seal Your House

Anything that lets air escape from your home – cracks in the foundation, gaps around doors and windows – will make your air conditioner work harder.

Seal any cracks or gaps with caulking or weather-stripping to help keep cool air inside and hot air outside. By doing this, you can improve your home’s energy efficiency and reduce your air conditioning costs.

### 12\. Keep Your House Clean

Another way to reduce air conditioning costs is to keep your house clean. Dust and dirt can make your air conditioner work harder and use more energy. To improve air quality and reduce air conditioning costs, regularly dust and vacuum your home.

### 13\. Change Your Old Cooling System

You can also save money on air conditioning by changing your old air conditioning system. If your air conditioner is more than 15 years old or frequently needs repair services, you might need AC installation. A newer AC system is much more energy-efficient than older models, so you can save a significant amount of money on your monthly energy bills.

Choose a new unit with an excellent energy-efficiency ratio, or EER, of at least 9. If possible, seek an Energy Star-certified unit with a high EER rating. A higher EER score indicates a more efficient air conditioner.

The Energy Star label identifies energy-efficient items like air conditioners. This designation means that the air conditioner meets or exceeds energy efficiency standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
