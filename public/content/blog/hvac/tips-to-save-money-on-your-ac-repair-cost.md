Summer is in full swing, which means one thing- it’s hot! Like most people, you’re probably running your air conditioner all day to stay cool.

But what happens when your AC breaks down and needs repair? Suddenly, that little bit of savings you had planned for vacation seems to disappear. Don’t worry- we have tips to help you save money on your AC repair cost.

## Tips to Save on Your Air Conditioning Repair

### Check Your Air Filters Monthly and Replace Them When Needed

Depending on the type of air conditioning system you have in your home, you may need to check and replace the air filter monthly. A clogged air filter can cause several problems with your air conditioner, including reduced airflow, increased energy consumption, and decreased efficiency.

By checking your air filters regularly, you can help to ensure that your air conditioner is operating at peak performance. In addition, changing your air filters regularly can also help to prolong the life of your AC unit. This kind of [maintenance](https://www.idesignac.com/get-ready-for-summer-with-professional-air-conditioner-maintenance/) is crucial. If you need help changing your air filter, consult your owner’s manual or call a local AC repair service.

### Close Off Vents in Rarely Used Rooms

If you want to reduce the energy your air conditioner uses, one of the best things you can do is close off vents in rooms you don’t use often. This will reduce the amount of air that needs to be cooled and can save you money on your energy bill.

Of course, if you have an older air conditioner, it may not be able to handle the reduced load, and you may need to have it repaired or replaced.

But newer air conditioners are much more efficient and can easily handle a reduced workload. So if you’re looking to save money on cooling costs, closing off vents in unused rooms is a great place to start.

### Set Your Thermostat to 78 Degrees or Higher in the Summertime

The evaporator coil in your air conditioner removes heat and humidity from the air in your home, making it cooler and more comfortable. But when it’s hot outside, the evaporator coil can struggle to keep up. As a result, your air conditioner has to work harder to cool your home, which can lead to higher energy bills and ac repair costs.

One way to help your evaporator coil do its job more effectively is to set your thermostat to 78 degrees or higher in the summertime. This may seem counterintuitive, but the hotter it is outside, the easier it is for your evaporator coil to remove heat from the air.

As a result, your air conditioner won’t have to work as hard, and you’ll enjoy lower energy bills and fewer ac repair costs. So next time it’s sweltering outside, don’t be tempted to crank down the AC—just let the hot air in and let your evaporator coil do its job.

### Install a Programmable Thermostat

Most central air conditioners have a programmable thermostat installed, which allows you to set the temperature to save energy when you’re not home. You can also set the thermostat to turn off the air conditioner when the temperature outside is cool enough.

If your central air conditioner doesn’t have a programmable thermostat, you can hire an air conditioner repair service to install one. A programmable thermostat can save you money on your energy bill and help you stay comfortable in your home. Your air conditioning systems can also do their job better.

### Use a Ceiling Fan With Your AC Unit

Many homeowners are surprised to learn that ceiling fans can circulate cool air throughout the house, helping save on air conditioning repair bills. In fact, ceiling fans are an excellent way to supplement your central air or air conditioning unit.

By circulating the air in your home, ceiling fans can help to reduce the strain on your air conditioning unit, potentially extending its lifespan. Additionally, ceiling fans can help to evenly distribute the cool air throughout your home, making it more comfortable for everyone.

And during the winter, ceiling fans can be reversed to circulate warm air, helping to take the chill out of the air. So if you’re looking for a way to save on air conditioning repair bills, consider using a ceiling fan. Just be sure to turn off the circuit breaker when you’re not using it to avoid any accidents. With this, your air conditioning equipment will not need to exert as much effort.

### Keep Your Window Blinds Down

As the weather gets warmer, many of us start cranking up the air conditioning to stay cool. But did you know that there are some simple things you can do to help reduce your air conditioning costs?

One of the easiest things to do is to keep your window blinds closed during the day. This helps to keep the sun from heating your home, making it easier for your air conditioner to do its job.

### Invest in Geothermal Air Conditioning Units

Lastly, you can consider investing in energy-efficient air conditioning units, like geothermal air conditioning units. These units can help you save money on your air conditioning costs over the long term. And if your air conditioner is starting to show its age, don’t wait until it breaks down to replace it.

A new air handler can cost as little as a couple of thousand dollars, and it will be much more efficient than your old one. So take some time researching your options and finding ways to save on your air conditioning this summer!

### Let Professionals Repair Your Air Conditioner

When the time comes for repairs to you AC unit, then you should call in the professionals. Many people think they can save money by repairing their air conditioners themselves, but this often leads to more costly repairs.

Not only do professionals have the experience and expertise to repair your air conditioner properly, but they also have the tools and equipment necessary to do the job right. If you try to repair your air conditioner on your own, you may end up causing more damage, which will ultimately cost you more money.
