In this article, we will provide you with a list of seven questions to ask when getting quotes for AC replacement. We’ll also give you tips on choosing the right company for the job.

### How to Choose the Right AC Replacement Company

It’s important to do your research when you’re looking for a company to replace your [air conditioning system](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/). You want to be sure you’re getting the best possible service at a fair price. Here are a few tips on how to choose the right company:

*   **Ask for recommendations:** Talk to your friends, family, and neighbors. See if they have any recommendations for [AC replacement](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/) companies in Tucson.
*   **Do your research:** Once you have a few companies in mind, look them up online. Read reviews from other customers. Check out their websites and social media pages.
*   **Get multiple quotes:** Don’t just go with the first company you find. Get quotes from multiple companies and compare them.
*   **Get everything in writing:** Once you’ve decided on a company, make sure you get everything in writing. This includes the price, the scope of work, and the timeline.

Now that you know how to choose the right company, let’s take a look at seven questions you should ask them when getting quotes for a new air conditioner system.

### 1\. What is the cost of the AC replacement?

Be sure to get a breakdown of the cost of materials and labor. Also, ask if there are any discounts or promotions that you can take advantage of.

Cost is important, but it shouldn’t be the only factor you consider when choosing a company for AC replacement. Be sure to also consider the quality of their work, their experience, and their customer service.

### 2\. What type of air conditioner unit do you recommend?

There are many different types of air conditioning units on the market. Some are more energy efficient than others. Some work better in certain climates. Be sure to ask the company what type of AC system they recommend for your home and why.

It’s also a good idea to ask about different features and options that are available. This way, you can make an informed decision about what’s best for your home and your budget. A cooling system is a big investment, so you want to be sure you’re getting the best possible product for your needs.

### 3\. What is the timeline for the air conditioning replacement?

Be sure to ask when the work will begin and how long it will take to complete. You don’t want to be without [air conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning) during the hot Tucson summer!

It’s also a good idea to ask about the company’s policy on weather delays. This can be a big factor in Tucson, where the weather can be unpredictable.

Asking about the timeline is also a good way to gauge a company’s professionalism. A company that is organized and efficient will be able to give you a clear timeline for the project.

On the other hand, a disorganized or inexperienced company may not be able to give you a clear timeline, which could mean delays and inconvenience for you.

### 4\. What is the expected lifespan of the new system?

An HVAC system is a big investment. You want to be sure your air conditioner replacement is done right the first time, so you don’t have to keep shelling out money for repairs or, even worse, a replacement sooner than expected. Be sure to ask your potential contractor about the expected lifespan of the new system.

If they are unsure, that’s a red flag! A quality replacement system should last you at least fifteen years, if not more.

Asking about the expected lifespan of the new system is a great way to gauge both the contractor’s knowledge and the quality of the replacement parts they’re using. If they can’t give you a straight answer or assure you that their work will stand the test of time, move on to the next contractor on your list.

### 5\. Will you be able to provide a warranty?

An entire AC system replacement should come with some kind of warranty. This protects you in case anything goes wrong with the workmanship or the parts used.

Be sure to ask about the length of the warranty and what it covers. The best warranties will cover both labor and parts for at least a year, but some companies may only offer a labor warranty or only cover certain parts. Air conditioners have a lot of moving parts, so you want to make sure all of them are covered!

Asking about the warranty is also a great way to gauge a company’s confidence in their work. If they’re unwilling to stand behind their product with a warranty, that’s a red flag. You don’t want to do business with a company that isn’t confident in their own work!

### 6\. What is the company’s policy on payment?

You will want to know what the company’s policy is on payment before you agree to work with them. Some companies may require a deposit upfront, while others may not. Be sure to ask about this so that you can be prepared.

Some companies also have different payment options available, so if you are concerned about paying the full amount upfront, be sure to ask about financing options or other payment plans.

### 7\. What are the company’s credentials?

When you’re looking for a contractor to replace your AC, you want to make sure you’re working with a reputable company. Be sure to ask about the company’s credentials, including how long they’ve been in business and if they’re licensed and insured. You can also ask for references from past clients. Checking out online reviews is also a good way to get a sense of what others have thought of the company’s work.

### Conclusion

Your current system may be on its last legs, but with a little research, you can be sure to find a reputable company to replace it. Asking the right questions is key to getting an accurate estimate and ensuring that your new system will be installed correctly. So don’t delay, ask these seven questions today!
