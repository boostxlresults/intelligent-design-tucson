When your air conditioner stops working, the first thing you need to do is find a reputable AC replacement company to help with your cooling needs. But before you do that, it’s important to learn about AC replacement so you can make an informed decision in choosing a new air conditioner.  
In this blog post, we will discuss 10 facts about AC replacement that everyone should know. Keep reading for more information!

### 1\. AC Replacement Can Be a Complicated and Expensive Process

When an entire AC system needs to be replaced, the process can be quite complicated. There are a lot of different parts that need to be removed and replaced, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

In addition, the job site can also be dangerous. This is why it’s important to hire a reputable company that has experience with AC replacement.

### 2\. Replacement Is Not Always the Best Option

Sometimes, repairs are all that is needed. A qualified technician will be able to assess your AC unit and determine whether repair or replacement is the best option. If your unit is relatively new and under warranty, repairs may be the best option.

Air conditioning units typically have a life expectancy of 15 years, so if your unit is older than that, it means that it is past its peak performance and may need replacement.

### 3\. The Type of Air Conditioner Affects Replacement Costs

If you have a central AC unit, a replacement will likely be more expensive than if you have a window AC unit. Central AC units are more complex and require the expertise of a certified technician. Different cooling systems will have different replacement costs, so be sure to ask your technician for an estimate.

### 4\. You Will Need to Factor in the Cost of Installation

When you are getting an estimate for AC replacement, be sure to ask about the cost of installation. This is often not included in the initial estimate, and can significantly add to the overall cost of replacement.

### 5\. The Size of the AC Unit Also Affects Replacement Costs

The size of your air conditioner is measured in tons. The larger the unit, the more it will cost to replace. This is because larger units require more materials and labor.

### 6\. You May Be Eligible for a Tax Credit With AC Replacement

If you replace your AC unit with a more energy-efficient model, you may be eligible for a tax credit. The amount of the credit will vary depending on the type of unit you purchase. Tax credits are typically available for central AC units and heat pumps.

### 7\. Replacement Usually Takes About Two Days

Once the decision has been made to replace your AC unit, the process usually takes about two days to complete. This includes the time it takes to remove the old unit and install the new one. Make sure to ask about the cost of the installation process, as this can add to the overall cost of replacement.

### 8\. You May Need to Replace Your Air Conditioner Every Few Years

Depending on how often you use your air conditioner, you may need to replace it every few years. If you live in an area with a hot climate, for example, your AC unit will need to be replaced more frequently than if you live in a cooler climate.

### 9\. AC Replacement Is Not Typically Covered By Home Insurance Policies

Home insurance policies typically do not cover AC replacement. It is considered a maintenance issue, not an unexpected event. If you have AC replacement coverage in your home insurance policy, it will likely be for a very limited amount.

### 10\. You Can Save Money on Your Energy Bill With AC Replacement

If your AC unit is more than 15 years old, it is probably time for an upgrade. Newer AC units are much more energy-efficient than older models. This means that you can save money on your energy bill by replacing your old unit with a new one. Energy costs are always rising, so this is a great way to save money in the long run.

Seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) is a good way to compare units.  
Replacing your current system with a new AC unit is a big decision, and it’s important to do your research before making a final decision. These 10 facts should give you a good starting point. Be sure to consult with a qualified technician to ensure that you are making the best decision for your home.

### Things to Consider When Choosing an Air Conditioning Replacement

A new cooling system is a significant investment. Here are some factors to consider before you make your decision:

**Size of the Unit:** You’ll need a unit that’s large enough to cool your entire home but not so large that it’s inefficient. A qualified technician can help you determine the right size for your needs. Square footage of the area can also lower energy usage, and ultimately, your energy costs.

**Type of Unit:** There are several different types of air conditioners, including central AC units, ductless mini-splits, and window units. The type you choose also affects air quality and energy efficiency. You may opt for types with built-in air purifiers to help with allergies and other respiratory concerns.

**SEER Rating:** The higher the SEER rating, the more energy-efficient the unit will be. This can save you money on your energy bill in the long run. Heating and cooling make up a large portion of most homeowners’ energy bills, so it’s worth considering this factor when making your decision.

**Location and Climate:** If you live in a hot climate, you’ll need a unit that’s designed to withstand the extreme heat. Conversely, if you live in a cooler climate, you’ll need a unit that’s designed to operate in lower temperatures. Heat load calculation will help determine the best unit for your needs.

**Warranty:** Be sure to ask about the warranty of the new unit before making a purchase. Most AC units come with a one-year warranty, but some manufacturers offer longer warranties.

**Home Layout:** The layout of your home can impact the type of unit you need. If you have a large home with multiple floors, for example, you’ll need a different type of unit than if you have a small home with only one floor.

**Budget:** Your budget is an important consideration when choosing a new AC unit. Be sure to get estimates from multiple companies before making a final decision. Special financing options may be available to help you afford the unit you need. Low monthly payments make it easier to budget for a new system.

When it comes to AC replacement, there are a lot of factors to consider. When you need to replace your entire system, it’s important to do your research and choose the best unit for your needs.
