### Intelligent Design Essential Services

In Southern Arizona, many businesses and local services remain closed to customers as the area attempts to control the number of cases of coronavirus. However, emergency HVAC services are considered to be an essential service. As an essential business, Intelligent Design of Tucson has remained open throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so. Please know that we are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the letter, and that we are taking every precaution to protect our customers and our staff.

### Our COVID-19 Precautions, Designed to Keep You Safe

Intelligent Design strives to provide emergency HVAC services as safely as possible. To that end, all of our technicians are monitored closely for signs of illness, and are sent home immediately if they exhibit possible symptoms. Before entering your home, all technicians will put on new gloves and foot covers. And of course, face coverings are mandatory at Intelligent Design. Furthermore, all of our employees are practicing frequent hand washing and sanitizing, and are observing social distance guidelines.

### Our Safety-Related Requests

During this time, we ask that you help us keep everyone safe. Whenever possible, our technicians will speak with you outside your home about your emergency HVAC services or other issues. We ask that you please help us observe social distancing guidelines by remaining six feet apart. Please also wear a mask or other face covering that covers your mouth and nose.

We have long been a paperless company, preferring to email estimates to reduce the amount of paper waste generated. However, we also now offer contactless payment, which many of our customers find more convenient as well as safer.

Plus, the Respicaire system does not require much maintenance. All that’s needed is the once per year replacement of the UV purifying lamp, as well as periodic replacement of the spiroplate.

Lastly, we ask you to monitor your health and the health of your household members. If anyone shows signs of illness ahead of your scheduled appointment, please call ahead to reschedule. We appreciate your efforts to help keep everyone safe and healthy.

### Our Full Suite of Essential Home Services

*   **Indoor air purifier:** The system we recommend uses UV light technology to effectively scrub the air of viruses, bacteria, and mold spores.
*   **Water filtration systems:** Now that your household members are staying at home more, you’re probably using more water than ever before. We recommend Enviro Water Products to keep your water clean and fresh-tasting.
