No one likes dealing with a broken air conditioner, especially in the middle of a heatwave. But while it’s tempting to put off calling for repairs, the sooner you do so, the better. Not only will you get your cool air back sooner, but you’ll also avoid more extensive (and expensive) damage down the road. So, how do you know when it’s time to call in a professional for an AC repair? Keep reading to find out.

## **Signs You Need AC Repair**

If your air conditioner is having any of the following issues, it’s time to call for repairs:

### **1\. Strange noises**

If your air conditioner starts making weird noises, it’s definitely time to call in a professional. Grinding, squealing, and rattling are all signs that something is wrong with your AC and it needs to be fixed before it breaks down completely.

### **2\. Weak or uneven airflow**

If you notice that the airflow from your AC is weak or uneven, it could be a sign that your air conditioner is frozen and needs to be thawed out or that the filter is dirty and needs to be replaced.

### **3\. Water leaks**

Central air conditioners can sometimes leak water, but this is usually a sign that the drain pan is full and needs to be emptied. If you notice water leaking from your AC unit, though, it could mean that there’s a more serious problem, like a refrigerant leak, that needs to be fixed by a professional.

### **4\. Refuses to turn on**

If your air conditioner doesn’t turn on at all, there could be a problem with the electrical connection or the thermostat. Either way, it’s best to call in a professional who can diagnose and fix the problem.

### **5\. High energy bills**

If you notice a sudden spike in your energy bills, it could be a sign that your air conditioner is working harder than it should cool your home. This could be due to a number of different issues, like a dirty filter or a refrigerant leak, so it’s best to call in a professional to take a look.

### **6\. Barely cools your home**

If your air conditioner is turned on, but it’s not doing a very good job of cooling your home, there could be a problem with the compress or the Freon levels. Again, this is something that a professional will need to take care of.

If your AC is making strange noises, won’t turn on, or isn’t cooling your home properly, then it’s time to call in a professional for an AC repair. Don’t wait until it’s too late—contact a qualified technician today so they can take a look at your air conditioner and get it running like new again.

## **The Best Time for Air Conditioning Repair**

### **During Spring**

The best time to call for AC repair is in the spring before the weather gets too hot. You can get your air conditioner serviced and avoid any unexpected breakdowns later. Springtime is also an excellent time to take care of any other maintenance tasks that your AC may need, such as replacing the filters.

Of course, if you notice any AC unit problems, don’t hesitate to call for help. The sooner you get the issue fixed, the better.

### **The Age of Your Air Conditioner**

Another thing you need to consider is the age of your air conditioning unit. If your unit is over ten years old, it’s probably time for an overhaul. Even if it’s still working, the efficiency of your unit will have decreased significantly over the years.

As a result, you’ll be paying more energy costs to keep your home cool. If your unit is nearing the end of its lifespan, it’s probably best to replace it before it breaks down completely.

### **AC Unit Usage**

Another factor to consider is how often you use your air conditioner. If you live in an area with a mild climate, you may not need to use your air conditioner very often. As a result, you can probably wait a little longer before getting a tune-up or repair.

On the other hand, if you live in a hotter climate and use your AC unit daily, getting it serviced regularly to keep it running at peak efficiency is essential. This is because hotter areas put more strain on air conditioners, leading to more frequent repairs.

## **Unexpected Need for Air Conditioner Repair Service**

Even if you take good care of your air conditioner, it may still break down unexpectedly. If this happens, don’t panic! Just give us a call, and we’ll send someone out to help as soon as possible.

We understand that an AC unit breakdown can be a stressful event. But with our experienced team of AC repair technicians, we’ll have your unit up and running in no time. Here are some of the most common AC repairs that we see:

*   **Refrigerant Leaks:** One of the most common AC repairs is fixing leaks in the refrigerant lines. If your unit is leaking refrigerant, it will need to be recharged.
*   **Compressor Issues:** The compressor is the heart of your air conditioner, so if it’s not working properly, your unit won’t be able to function. We can repair or replace compressors that have failed.
*   **Condenser Issues:** The condenser is another important component of your air conditioner. If it’s not working properly, your unit will overheat and shut down. We can clean or replace your condenser if necessary.
*   **Ductwork Issues:** If your ductwork is leaking, it can cause your air conditioner to work harder than necessary. We can repair or replace ductwork that has been damaged.
*   **Thermostat Issues:** If your thermostat is not working properly, it can cause your air conditioner to run too much or not enough. We can repair or replace thermostats that are not working correctly.

No matter what issue you’re having with your air conditioner, we can help! We’re here to provide AC repair service when you need it most. Give us a call today to schedule a repair appointment.

## **Save on Your AC Repair Cost**

As the temperature rises, so does the cost of air conditioning repairs. So if your central air conditioner is on the fritz, you’re probably wondering how you can save on ac repair costs.

You can do a few things to keep your air conditioner in good working order and avoid costly repairs.

### **Change Air Conditioning Systems Filter**

First, change the air filter regularly. A clogged air filter will make your air conditioner work harder, leading to expensive repairs down the road.

### **Get Help From HVAC Repair Company**

Second, have your air conditioner serviced by a professional at least once a year. This will help ensure that your unit runs efficiently and catch any potential problems before they become expensive repairs.

### **Keep Air Conditioning Equipment from Debris**

Remember to keep your air conditioning unit’s area clear of debris and leaves. Debris can block airflow and prevent your air conditioner from operating at peak efficiency.

Leaves can also fall into your unit and clog the drains, causing water damage. Check your air conditioning unit regularly to ensure it is clean and debris-free.

### **The Right Temperature**

Be sure to keep your thermostat set to a comfortable temperature. Turning up the AC too high will put unnecessary strain on your unit and could lead to costly repairs.

### **Regular Check-ups**

Finally, keep your air conditioning equipment running properly; you should have an annual maintenance check. The air conditioner’s refrigerant levels are checked during maintenance, and the air conditioner’s parts are oiled. This prevents the air conditioner from overheating and maintains its cooling efficiency.

By following these simple tips, you can keep your air conditioner running all summer long – and save a lot of money on ac repair costs.

## **Geothermal Air Conditioning Units Repair**

Geothermal air conditioning units are a great way to keep your home cool and comfortable during the hot summer. However, like any other AC unit, they can need repairs from time to time.

One common repair that you may need is an AC expansion valve replacement. This occurs when the evaporator coil in your geothermal unit becomes frozen and can no longer effectively absorb heat.

As a result, your AC unit will need to work harder to cool your home, which can lead to higher energy bills. However, a qualified AC technician can replace the expansion valve and get your geothermal unit back up.

## **Conclusion**

When your AC unit breaks down, it can be difficult to know whether you need a repair or replacement. In general, if your unit is more than 10 years old or if the repair costs are more than half the cost of a new unit, it’s probably time for a replacement. However, every situation is unique, so it’s important to consult with a qualified HVAC technician to get expert advice.

If you’re in need of AC repair or replacement in the Tucson area, contact the experts at Intelligent Design today! We’ll help you keep your cool all summer long.
