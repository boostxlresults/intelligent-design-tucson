If you are a resident of Tucson, Arizona, you know all too well how hot it gets during the summer months. In order to stay comfortable and keep your energy bills manageable, it is crucial that you maximize the efficiency of your air conditioning system.

In this post, we will provide you with helpful tips on how to maximize your air conditioning system’s efficiency and save money. You will be surprised by how easy it is to lower your energy bills without sacrificing comfort.

## How Does Air Conditioning Work

Knowing how AC works will help you get the most out of it. [Air conditioning](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-installation-tucson/) systems use refrigerants to absorb heat from the air inside your home, transfer it outside and then release cool air back into the house. The condenser fan is responsible for drawing outdoor air over the condenser coil to dissipate heat energy from within the system.

If any of these components are not working properly, it can cause your air conditioner to run inefficiently and increase your energy bills. However, there are some ways you can do for your AC to work properly and extend its life.

Doing those things can ensure you are maximizing your AC’s efficiency and saving money in the process. Read on to learn how to maximize your AC efficiency and save money.

## Ways to Maximize Your AC’s Efficiency

As we all know, air conditioning systems use a lot of energy. But you can take a few easy steps to reduce your air conditioner’s energy consumption and save money. These ways can also help keep your air conditioning unit in peak condition for longer.

### Change the Air Filter

One of the easiest ways to maximize your AC’s efficiency is to change the air filter regularly. Your HVAC system works harder when there is a dirty or clogged air filter, which can cause higher energy bills and more frequent breakdowns. It is important to [check](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/) the filter every month and replace it when necessary.

### Schedule Regular Maintenance

It is also a good idea to schedule [regular maintenance](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/) for your air conditioning system. A trained technician can identify potential problems with your unit before they become more serious.

They can also inspect the parts of the unit and provide you with advice on how to get the most out of your system. Regular maintenance can help your unit run more efficiently, saving you money on energy bills.

### Use a Programmable Thermostat

Another great way to maximize your AC’s efficiency is to use a programmable thermostat. These thermostats allow you to set the temperature for different times of the day so your unit isn’t running when it doesn’t need to be. This can help lower your energy bills and ensure your system runs efficiently throughout its lifespan.

### Invest in a High-Quality AC Unit

Choosing a reliable AC unit and having it [installed](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-installation-tucson/) by a reputable HVAC company can save you money in the long run by reducing the need for costly repairs and maintenance. Be sure to check with the Better Business Bureau to find a reputable HVAC company with good customer reviews.

### Implement Energy-Saving Strategies

Implementing energy-saving strategies such as turning off lights and unplugging unused appliances in your home can help reduce your AC’s energy consumption. Additionally, you can keep the temperature a few degrees higher when you’re not at home to save on energy costs. Some of the energy-saving strategies also include:

*   Installing energy-efficient windows: Installing energy-efficient windows can help reduce your cooling costs by up to 15%.
*   Planting trees and shrubs around the house: Strategically planting trees and shrubs around your home can provide natural shade and reduce the heat that enters your home.
*   Using ceiling fans: Ceiling fans can help circulate cool air throughout your home, making it feel cooler without cramming up the AC.
*   Investing in shades, blinds, or curtains: This helps block the sunlight and keep your home cooler.

### Upgrade to a More Efficient Model

If you have an older AC unit, upgrading to a more energy-efficient model can save you money in the long run by reducing your energy consumption. As an air conditioner ages, its efficiency decreases, leading to higher utility bills.

A newer model may have more advanced features, such as better energy-saving technology, improved air filtration, and quieter operation. Some of the benefits you can get from a new HVAC system include the following:

*   Increased energy efficiency: Newer AC units use less energy than older models.
*   Improved air filtration: New HVAC systems come with enhanced air filters that remove more airborne particles and allergens, creating a healthier environment in your home.
*   More reliable operation: Newer AC units are designed to last longer and require less maintenance.

### Set the Thermostat Wisely

Having a thermostat doesn’t mean you are using it effectively. Setting the thermostat too high or too low can cause your AC unit to work harder and use more energy, resulting in higher utility bills. You should set the thermostat between 78-82 degrees Fahrenheit for maximum efficiency.

Why do this? You can save more money by setting your thermostat higher when remaining cool is not as important. During sleep time or whenever leaving home in the summer, set the temperature at 82 degrees and 85 degrees, respectively, for maximum savings!
