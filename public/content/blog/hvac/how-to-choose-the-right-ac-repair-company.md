No one wants to deal with a broken air conditioning unit in the middle of summer. If your AC stops working, it’s important to find a reliable repair company as soon as possible. How do you know which company is right for you? There are a few things you should consider when choosing an [AC repair company](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/). Keep reading to learn more!

### Tip #1: Online Customer Reviews

When searching for an AC repair contractor, one of the best places to look is online. A quick Google search will reveal a variety of customer reviews from past clients. You can learn a lot about a company by reading what others say.

[Customer reviews](https://www.idesignac.com/testimonials/) will give you a good idea of the quality of work you can expect and whether or not the company is reliable. The review must be honest and trustworthy. Avoiding that company is probably the best option if you see many negative reviews.

Take your time to read through a few reviews before making a decision. The air conditioner is a vital part of your home, and you want to be sure the repair company you choose is up to the task.

### Tip #2: Experience & Qualifications

If you’re looking for an AC repair company, you want to ensure they have the experience and qualifications to do the job right. Check to see if the company is appropriately licensed and insured. Here are some other things to look for:

*   How long has the company been in business?
*   Do they have any special certifications or training?
*   What kind of experience do their technicians have?

You should know the company’s capabilities well when you’re done checking for these qualifications. This will help you narrow down your options and choose the right AC repair company for your needs. The air conditioner repair service you pick should have everything required to get the job done right so you can have peace of mind.

### Tip #3: Proper Business Insurance

Businesses can be sued for a variety of reasons. If an [HVAC company](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/) doesn’t have proper business insurance, you could be on the hook financially if something goes wrong. Make sure the company you’re considering has adequate insurance coverage. If you hire an uninsured company and something goes wrong, you may have to pay for damages out of pocket.

For example, suppose an employee of the company is injured while working on your AC unit. In that case, you may be liable if the company doesn’t have workers’ compensation insurance and the employee sues you. Don’t take chances – ensure the AC repair company you’re considering is properly insured.

### Tip #4: Check the HVAC License & Certificates

You must consider one of the most important factors when hiring an AC repair contractor. Ensure that the contractor has a valid license to operate in your area and that they have all the necessary certifications from credible organizations.

Checking the license and certificates of an AC repair company is not as difficult as it may sound. You can easily find this information on the company’s website or ask them for it directly. Here are some of the most important things to look for:

*   A valid license from the state in which the company operates.
*   Certifications from credible organizations, such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or the [Air Conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning) Contractors of America (ACCA).
*   Positive reviews from past clients.

Remember that not all states require contractors to have a license, so this may not be applicable in your case. However, checking for certifications from credible organizations is still a good idea. This will give you peace of mind knowing that the company you hire is reputable and has the experience to do the job right.

### Tip #5: Look for a Credible Warranty

The last thing you want is to be stuck with an AC repair company that doesn’t stand by its work. Make sure the company you’re considering offers a warranty on their repairs. This will give you peace of mind knowing that if something goes wrong, you’re covered.

A good AC repair company will also offer a maintenance plan to properly keep your unit running all year. This can save you money in the long run by preventing costly repairs down the road. Warranties indicate that the company you’re working with is confident in its abilities and wants to ensure your satisfaction.

When choosing an AC repair company, don’t skimp on quality. Do your research and choose a company that will stand by its work. With a little effort, you can find a great company that will keep your AC unit running smoothly for years to come.

### Tip #6: AC Repair Cost

Beware of companies that give you a low estimate to get your business, only to find out later that the price was just for the diagnostic fee. A good repair company will estimate the total cost of repairs before any work is started. On the other hand, some companies will give you a very high estimate in hopes that you’ll just go away.

Do your research and get multiple estimates to find the fair price for air conditioning repair. Also, try to find a company that offers flat-rate pricing, so you’ll know exactly how much the repairs will cost. The cost of AC repairs can vary depending on the severity of the problem.

However, you shouldn’t have to pay for an arm and a leg for simple repairs. For example, an air handler replacement cost shouldn’t be more than $1,500 to $3,400 to replace. AC expansion valve repair shouldn’t be more than $350. If a company is trying to charge you more, it’s probably because they’re trying to take advantage of you. Be sure to research and find a reputable AC repair company that will give you a fair price for the repairs you need.

### Tip #7: Inquire About the Process

Air conditioning systems are a significant investment. You want to be sure that the company you choose has a solid process for repairing your system. Here are a few questions to ask:

*   How will you diagnose the problem?
*   What are your repair options?
*   What is your process for repair?
*   How long will the repairs take?

Answering these questions will help you better understand the company and its process. With this knowledge, you can make a more informed decision on who to trust with your AC repair.

### What Are the Most Common AC Problems?

Having a broken air conditioner is never fun, especially during the hottest days of summer. But before you call an AC repair company, it’s helpful to know the most common AC problems. Here are four of the most common issues that homeowners face:

1.  **Air conditioners not blowing** – One of the most common AC problems is when your air conditioner isn’t blowing air. This could be because the fan isn’t working, an airflow restriction or the evaporator coil is frozen.
2.  **Leaking water** – If you notice water leaking from your AC unit, it could be due to a clogged drain line or a problem with the condensate pump.
3.  **AC not cooling** – Air conditioning units that aren’t cooling correctly are usually low on refrigerant. The hot air might also be coming from a dirty air filter or blocked return duct.
4.  **Strange noises** – Hearing strange noises from your AC unit is usually a sign that something is loose, such as the fan blades or blower motor.

Air conditioning equipment is a significant investment, so it’s essential to know the most common AC problems. By knowing what to look for, you can take action to prevent or fix these issues as soon as they arise.

### Conclusion

Picking the right AC repair company doesn’t have to be a daunting task. Just do your research, get multiple estimates and inquire about the process. By following these tips, you can find a reputable company that will give you fair prices and quality repairs.
