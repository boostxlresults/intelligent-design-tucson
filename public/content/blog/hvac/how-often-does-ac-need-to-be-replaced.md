If you live in a hot climate, your air conditioner is one of the most important appliances in your home. But how often does it need to be replaced? Depending on the type of AC unit, and how well it is maintained, most units will last between 10 and 15 years. However, several factors can shorten the lifespan of your AC unit.

In this blog post, we’ll discuss some of those factors and give you some tips on how to extend the life of your AC unit. If you’re wondering how often AC needs to be replaced, keep reading!

## Factors That Affect an Air Conditioner’s Longevity

When it comes to answering the question of how often an [air conditioner](https://www.idesignac.com/get-ready-for-summer-with-professional-air-conditioner-maintenance/) needs to be replaced, it is important to consider a few factors. Here are a few of the most common:

*   **Surroundings** – Air conditioning units that are exposed to the elements, such as those located on balconies, tend to have a shorter lifespan than units installed indoors. In addition, units placed in areas with high levels of dust or dirt may need to be replaced sooner than expected.
*   **Humidity** – Your central air conditioner works best when the air is dry. If you live in an area that tends to be humid, your [AC unit may not last](https://www.idesignac.com/how-long-do-ac-units-last/) as long since it will have to work harder to maintain a comfortable temperature. The same applies to areas with high levels of pollution.
*   **Run time** – Your air conditioner replacement schedule may depend on how often you use it. If you use your AC consistently, it will likely need to be replaced more frequently than if it is only used occasionally. This is because frequent use causes the unit to work harder, resulting in more wear and tear.
*   **Poor installation** – AC system installation is not a DIY project. If you are considering installing an air conditioner yourself or hiring someone who isn’t properly qualified, it may lead to improper installation and cause your system to be less efficient. This will significantly reduce its lifespan.
*   **Lack of maintenance** – New AC unit installation is just the start of your air conditioning system’s journey. To ensure that your unit runs efficiently and effectively, it needs regular maintenance from a qualified technician. This means cleaning the filters, inspecting parts for wear and tear, checking refrigerant levels, and other tasks as needed. Without regular maintenance, an AC unit can become less efficient or stop working altogether.

By considering these factors and understanding the importance of regular maintenance, you can determine how often your AC unit should be replaced. It is important to have a qualified technician inspect your system every two or three years to ensure it is running efficiently and effectively. If any repairs are needed, contact us for assistance. We are here to help you keep your home comfortable all year round.

### So, How Often Does the AC Need to be Replaced?

The frequency of air conditioner replacement depends on the age and condition of the unit, as well as how often you use it. Generally speaking, most home AC units should be replaced every 10-15 years. It is important to keep up with regular maintenance such as changing filters and inspecting for any potential issues to prolong the life of your unit.

If your HVAC system is more than 10-15 years old, it may be worth considering replacing it with a new, energy-efficient model to save money in the long run. Additionally, if you find that your AC needs repairs more often than not, then it may be wise to invest in a newer model as well. Also, the furnace or air handler should be inspected and serviced by a professional every year.

### Maintenance Tips to Prolong Your AC Unit’s Life

Though it is recommended you replace your AC unit every 10-15 years, there are steps you can take to keep your air conditioning running smoothly and extend its life. Here are some maintenance tips from the experts:

**1\. Replace your air filters regularly**

An air conditioning unit can only cool your home efficiently when it has the right amount of airflow. Dirty air filters can block clean air from entering your unit and cause serious damage over time. Cleaning or replacing the filters regularly will help prolong the life of your AC unit. The heating and cooling costs in your home can also be reduced with clean air filters.

**2\. Clean or replace the condenser coils on time**

The condenser coils in your AC unit help to remove heat from the air and release it outside. Over time, debris and dust particles accumulate on these coils causing them to overheat and stop functioning properly. Having these coils cleaned or replaced regularly will improve the airflow of your unit and increase its efficiency.

The cooling system should be checked annually for any dirt and debris buildup, and the coils should be replaced if necessary. This will help ensure that your AC unit is running as efficiently as possible and can help prevent unnecessary [AC repairs](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/) or replacements in the future.

**3\. Check the refrigerant levels**

The HVAC equipment will not function properly if the refrigerant levels are low. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and ensure that both the air conditioner’s compressor and condenser hold adequate refrigerant levels. If not, then you should consider having a professional come out and check the system for any signs of leakage or inefficient cooling. The cool air in your home will remain cool and consistent as long as the levels of refrigerant are at the right levels.

**4\. Get your AC unit serviced by a professional regularly**

A new HVAC system should be serviced at least twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall. This will help keep your AC unit running smoothly throughout the year and prevent any potential problems that may arise.

During the service, a professional can inspect all of the components inside the unit to check for any signs of wear or damage. Not only can this help extend the life of your unit, but it can also alert you to potential problems that may require attention before they become bigger issues.

By taking these steps and following a regular maintenance plan for your AC unit, you will help ensure its longevity and [avoid costly repairs](https://www.idesignac.com/tips-to-maintain-your-air-conditioner-and-avoid-costly-repairs/) or replacements in the future. Remember, a well-maintained air conditioning unit can last up to 15 years or more, depending on the type of unit you have.
