### Common Reasons to Schedule an Air Conditioning Service in Tucson Visit

There are many reasons why you might need to schedule an Air Conditioning Service in Tucson visit. Here’s a look at a few common ones:

*   You notice uneven cooling, or hot and cold pockets throughout your home.
*   The AC has a leak and as a result, you have low refrigerant levels.
*   Your AC’s evaporator coils have frozen.
*   The condenser coils are failing.
*   The fan isn’t working properly.
*   Your home’s ductwork has leaks, causing poor airflow and distribution.

Another common reason to schedule an AC service visit is high energy bills. It’s normal for electricity bills to go up during the summer. However, if you’ve noticed your home’s energy usage is a great deal higher than usual, it’s time to call an AC repair company.

### Possible Solutions to Your AC Problems

Your Air Conditioning Service in Tucson professional can troubleshoot the cause of your AC problems and recommend repairs. For instance, you might need a new fan or your ductwork might need repairs. In some cases, however, it’s more cost-effective in the long run to replace the entire system, particularly if yours is older.

Replacing your current AC with a new system will reduce your energy bills and eliminate problems like uneven cooling of your home. Plus, about 90% of Arizona homes have an improperly installed AC. A new, accurately sized and expertly installed system will keep your home comfortable for years to come.

### Ways to Keep Your AC Operating at Peak Efficiency

Whether you decide to install a new central AC or you want to keep your old one for a few more years, there are some steps you can take to keep it running properly. It’s crucial to schedule routine Air Conditioning Service in Tucson visits. Most manufacturers recommend scheduling an AC tune-up at the start of the cooling season and a second one in the fall.

The AC service professional will clean out the system, ensure working parts are lubricated, and replace any malfunctioning parts. In addition, be sure to replace your air filter as soon as it gets clogged.
