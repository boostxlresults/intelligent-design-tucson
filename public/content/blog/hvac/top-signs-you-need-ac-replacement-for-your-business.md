If your existing unit isn’t keeping your business sufficiently cool or warm, or if your equipment is going on the fritz more frequently than it did in the past, it could be time for routine AC maintenance.

A new AC system is always a good idea for your business. If you’er ready for a new AC system, it’s time to call a professional.

However, having your current system evaluated by a professional at least once every two years is also a good idea. Here are some of the most common signs you may need AC replacement or repair.

## **Does Your Air Conditioner Need Cleaning?**

Is your air conditioner not working as well as it used to? If you notice that the cooling is not as cold, or even worse, if your ac unit seems unable to cool and you’re feeling hot, it’s time for a check-up.

*   If your air conditioning units are blowing hot air, it’s time to call a professional to clean the indoor coil.
*   A dirty air filter also affects how well your air conditioners work. When your filter is dirty and clogged, it limits the amount of cold air in your home. 
*   If you notice that your vents are dusty or they are collecting spider webs, call in a professional for cleaning. This will help reduce allergens in your home and improve air quality overall.

### **Checking the Entire HVAC System**

If your air handler is dirty, it’s time to call a professional for cleaning. A dirty air handler can lead to severe issues with the entire HVAC unit, such as decreased efficiency and energy costs. 

That is why it’s crucial to have your air handlers cleaned regularly by an HVAC professional. If you have more than two HVAC units, check on them every few months, as it’s better to be safe than sorry. 

If your HVAC equipment is malfunctioning, call the HVAC company to find the root cause.

A room with conditioned air should have a cool breeze. If one of your air conditioning system’s parts is not working, you will face costly repairs. Professional HVAC contractors will ensure your system works well.

A new HVAC system will come with a warranty, but it is only valid if professionals install your unit correctly. 

The HVAC contractor should also provide maintenance on the new unit to ensure it lasts as long as possible, but you still need to maintain it. In addition, a new HVAC unit requires a professional HVAC contractor to install it for you.

## **Air Conditioner Installation Costs**

HVAC units can be expensive to install and maintain. Therefore, you should ask your HVAC contractor to estimate the costs of installing a new unit. 

There are many different heating and cooling systems, so you must choose the right one for your home. However, if you’re hesitant, the right company will provide the perfect quote and a free estimate for the installation costs.

The total cost will depend on what kind of unit you want to install. The average costs range from [$3,000 to $7,000](https://modernize.com/hvac/cost-calculator/central-ac-unit-installation). Meanwhile, the labor costs range from [$1,000 to $5,000,](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/hvac/ac-installation-cost/) depending on the AC unit type. 

The total cost will range from [$4,000 to $14,000.](https://modernize.com/hvac/cost-calculator/central-ac-unit-installation) This includes the installation costs.

### **AC Unit Heating and Cooling Costs**

If you’ve decided to install a new air conditioner in your home, call a professional for help. 

Installation can be tricky, and frequent repairs will become costly if something goes wrong. In addition, installation costs for your ac unit will depend on the size of the air conditioning unit.

The seasonal energy efficiency ratio will affect costs, considering your central AC unit works hard to keep your home at a comfortable temperature throughout the year. 

Taking care of your air conditioning system can help it last longer and use less energy. Energy efficiency will provide you with a longer life expectancy for your air conditioning system.

## **Maintaining Your Air Conditioning System**

Every day, thousands of businesses across the U.S. and Canada trust their commercial HVAC units to keep their employees and businesses cool during hot days. 

Maintaining these AC systems is crucial to ensure they work at total capacity during the hottest times of the year.

The best way to do this is by employing a professional to handle your hard work. There is no better way to ensure that your system will stay in peak condition year after year than to hire a pro. 

That way, all it takes is a few hours every year to protect your costly and vital system from wasting away on its own.
