There is a simple reason for an air conditioning unit not cooling. It’s broken! But in all seriousness, there are many things that can go wrong with a central air conditioner. These appliances are very intricate machines with many moving parts. There is a lot that can go wrong with them, which is why it’s best to call an expert for help. In Southern Arizona, an air conditioning unit not cooling is something that we deal with every day at Intelligent Design. Often, customers ask us for the solution over the phone. However, since central ACs are complex machines, it’s simply not possible to do a diagnostic over the phone. A technician will have to come out to your property to do a full, in-person diagnostic.

### Air Conditioning Unit Not Cooling: Improper Installation

If you’re like most people, you probably want to save money whenever possible. This might mean contracting with an uncertified HVAC company (or perhaps a friend who considers themselves to be a “handyman”) to install your new central air conditioner. This is problematic for many reasons. First, it will void your warranty, which means you’ll be on the hook for the repairs. Second, you won’t have the benefit of professional guidance when choosing the right size and capacity of AC for your home. And third, the AC is almost certainly going to be installed incorrectly.

Installing, diagnosing, and repairing an AC isn’t a DIY project. Just consider this: Here at Intelligent Design, we routinely work on the central ACs of professional contractors. These are people who understand how to fix many problems within the home, but they still call us because they know it takes an expert to fix a central AC.

If an air conditioning unit not cooling was recently installed by an uncertified technician or by a “friend of a friend,” then it’s likely malfunctioning because it wasn’t installed properly. You’ll need to work with a certified HVAC technician from a reputable company to fix the problem.

### AC Not Cooling: Refrigerant Leak

Every central air conditioner requires refrigerant to cool the air. Specifically, the refrigerant is responsible for absorbing the heat energy from the air, which cools it down. Then, the AC pushes the chilled air back into your home to lower the temperature. One possible cause of an air conditioning unit not cooling is a low level of refrigerant.

Since refrigerant doesn’t get lost through the normal operation of the AC, a low refrigerant level can only mean one thing: You have a leak. Other possible signs of a refrigerant leak include a bubbling or hissing noise and ice buildup on the refrigerant line. If you suspect a refrigerant leak, shut off the AC and call an HVAC technician. Sometimes, if you continue to run an AC that is low on refrigerant, the compressor can sustain damage. The technician can locate the leak, fix it, and recharge your system with more refrigerant.

### Air Conditioning Unit Not Cooling: Compressor Problems

The compressor is responsible for circulating refrigerant in the air conditioner. If your compressor is broken, your air conditioner will be unable to properly cool your air. Some other possible signs of a faulty compressor include the following:

*   Screeching or clattering noises coming from the AC
*   Repetitive tripping of the circuit breaker
*   Decreased air flow from the vents

If you have a hard time getting your AC to turn on, this can also indicate a bad compressor. The technician can repair or replace the compressor to get your home cooled off again.

### AC Unit Not Cooling: Air Filter Issues

Every HVAC system has an air filter designed to trap dirt, dust, pollen, pet dander, and other contaminants. The filter removes these airborne pollutants from the air before they can be recirculated throughout your home. It’s an essential piece of equipment that maintains your indoor air quality. Yet, many homeowners forget about cleaning or replacing the filter on a regular basis.

If your AC isn’t blowing out cold air, it may be because the air filter is clogged and dirty. The AC will have a hard time pushing cold air through the filter. This results in the temperature in your home rising. It will also decrease the overall lifespan of your air conditioner and increase the risk of expensive repairs. Ask your HVAC technician how often you should be changing your air filter.
