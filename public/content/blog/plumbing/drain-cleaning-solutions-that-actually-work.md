Keeping your drains clean is an essential home maintenance aspect many overlook. Not only does a clogged drain cause inconvenience, but it can also lead to costly repairs and health hazards. 

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of keeping the drains clean and the difference between commercial and homemade cleaning solutions. We will also share the top 8 drain cleaning solutions that actually work.

## **The Importance of Keeping the Drains Clean**

The drains in our homes carry away wastewater, debris, and other materials that can accumulate over time and cause clogs. When a drain gets clogged, it can cause water to back up, resulting in unpleasant smells, stagnant water, and even damage to the plumbing system. 

Clogged drains and standing water can also attract pests and insects, creating a breeding ground for bacteria and other harmful microorganisms. These can lead to severe diseases, including salmonella, E. coli, and cholera.

## **Commercial Vs. Homemade Cleaning Solutions**

When it comes to drain cleaning, you have two options: commercial or homemade cleaning solutions. Commercial cleaning products contain chemicals designed to dissolve and break down clogs quickly. However, they can harm the environment and damage your plumbing system if used improperly. 

On the other hand, homemade cleaning solutions are natural and eco-friendly but may not be as effective as commercial products. But proper use and regular maintenance can help prevent clogs and keep your drains clean. 

## **Top 8 Drain Cleaning Solutions That Actually Work**

### **Boiling Water**

Boiling water is the simplest and most natural way to unclog a drain. It works by melting and flushing away any buildup in the drain. To use boiling water, simply heat water to a rolling boil and pour it down the drain.

### **Baking Soda and Vinegar**

Baking soda and vinegar are two natural ingredients that clean up clogged bathroom drains. Baking soda is a natural abrasive that can break down stubborn clogs, while vinegar is an acid that can dissolve buildup.

To use baking soda and vinegar, mix equal parts of both ingredients and pour the mixture down the drain. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then flush the drain with hot water.

### **Drain Snake**

A drain snake is a long, flexible tool that can reach deep clogs in the drain. To use a drain snake, insert the tool into the drain and twist it clockwise until you feel resistance.

Then, pull the snake out, along with any debris that may have been causing the clog. [Professional plumbers](https://www.idesignac.com/services/plumbing/) use this tool, making it an effective drain-cleaning solution. 

### **Salt and Hot Water**

Salt and hot water are another simple and effective way to clean drains. Salt acts as a natural abrasive that can help break down clogs, while hot water can flush away debris.

To use salt and hot water, mix 1/2 cup of salt with boiling water and pour it down the drain. If it has yet to be unclogged after the first pour, repeat the process until you succeed. 

### **Baking Soda and Salt**

Another combo of natural ingredients that work well together to clean up clogged kitchen drains is baking soda and salt. Baking soda can break down stubborn clogs, while salt can be a natural abrasive.

To use baking soda and salt, mix 1/2 cup of baking soda with 1/2 cup of salt and pour the mixture down the drain. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then flush the drain with hot water.

### **Dish Soap and Hot Water**

Dish soap and hot water are another simple and effective way to clean drains. Dish soap can break down grease and other stubborn clogs, while hot water can remove debris.

To use dish soap and hot water, pour a cup of dish soap down the drain and let it sit for about 30 minutes before flushing with hot water. 

Remember to use a high-quality dishwashing soap, as cheap brands may not work. So, use one that is proven to combat stubborn grease.

### **Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda**

Hydrogen peroxide and baking soda are two natural ingredients that can be used to clean drains. Hydrogen peroxide can dissolve buildup, while baking soda can break down stubborn clogs. 

To use hydrogen peroxide and baking soda, mix 1/2 cup of each ingredient and pour the mixture down the drain. Let it sit for about an hour, then flush the sink drain with hot water.

### **Commercial Drain Cleaners**

Commercial drain cleaners are chemical solutions that dissolve and break down clogs quickly. They come in various forms, including liquids, gels, and powders, and can be found at most home improvement stores. 

To use commercial drain cleaners, follow the instructions on the product carefully, as they can be harmful if used improperly. It is also important to note that commercial drain cleaners can damage the environment and should be used sparingly.

## **Final Tips for Preventing Clogs and Maintaining Clean Drains**

In addition to using the cleaning solutions listed above, there are several things you can do to prevent sewer clogs and maintain clean drains. These include:

*   Avoid pouring grease and oil down the drain
*   Use a strainer to catch hair and other debris
*   Flush your drains regularly with hot water
*   Avoid flushing non-flushable items down the toilet

## **How to Find the Right Plumbing Company**

Hiring the right plumbing company is important if you let the professional do the job rather than DIY. It is no secret that nowadays, many plumbing companies claim to be the best; however, we all know that not all tell the truth.

Most plumbing issues are complex and need special skills to do the job correctly. So how do you choose the best plumbing company? Here are some tips to follow:

### **Licensing and Insurance**

It’s essential to hire a licensed and insured plumbing company to protect your property and ensure the job is done correctly.

Licensed plumbers have passed tests to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise. Insurance coverage protects you from potential damage to your property or injuries sustained by the plumber.

### **Reputation**

The reputation of the [plumbing company](https://www.idesignac.com/) is an essential factor to consider. Check online reviews and ratings on social media or review websites such as Yelp or Google.

You can also ask for references from friends and family who may have used their services in the past. A reputable plumbing company will have many positive reviews and testimonials.

### **Experience**

Plumbing is a specialized trade that requires experience and training. The more experienced a plumber is, the more likely they are to solve complex problems. It’s crucial to ask the company about their experience level and the types of jobs they’ve handled.

### **Services Offered**

Different plumbing companies specialize in different areas of plumbing. Some may only offer residential plumbing services, while others specialize in commercial plumbing or provide 24/7 emergency sewer cleaning services. Consider the type of plumbing services you require and ensure the company offers them.

### **Pricing**

While pricing shouldn’t be the sole factor in choosing a plumbing company, it is essential to ensure their prices are reasonable and competitive. A reputable plumbing company will provide an estimate upfront and be transparent about additional charges or fees.

### **Availability**

It’s important to find a plumbing company that’s available when you need them. Consider their business hours, emergency services, and response time. A reliable plumbing company will have a quick response time and be available 24/7 in emergencies.
