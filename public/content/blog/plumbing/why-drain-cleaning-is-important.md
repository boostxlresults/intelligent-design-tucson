If you’ve ever had a clogged drain, you know how frustrating it can be. It’s one of those problems that can seem impossible to resolve, and when you’re standing in your kitchen with a sink full of dirty dishes and dinner ready to go in the oven, it’s easy to wish for a quick fix. If you don’t take care of your drains, clogs can become much more serious problems down the road.

That’s why we’ve put together this blog post on why drain cleaning is important. We’ll talk about how clogs form, what they mean for your pipes and plumbing system, and how often you should have your drains cleaned by professionals.

We’ll also provide some tips on how to keep your drains clean so that they don’t get clogged in the first place.

## **What Causes Clogged Drains**

Clogged drains are a common problem in any home or business. Poorly maintained drains can lead to serious problems such as flooding, mold and mildew growth, and even structural damage. If you have noticed that your drain is clogged and you need help cleaning it out, it is important to take action quickly before the issue becomes more serious.

There are several causes of clogged drains, including:

*   **Fats and oils from cooking –** Grease can build up in the drain and cause it to slow down or even become completely blocked.
*   **Food particles that are not disposed of properly –** This includes bones, egg shells, pits and seeds, and other items that should not be flushed down the toilet.
*   **Grease-trapping utensils –** These are utensils designed to prevent grease from entering the sink drain. They can become clogged over time if not cleaned out regularly.
*   **Paper towel –** Paper towels can cause blockages when they are discarded into the sink rather than thrown away in the trashcan.
*   **Hair –** Hair can clog the drain, especially if it is long enough to get tangled around the pipe.
*   **Cosmetic and cleaning products –** These include creams and gels that can cause blockages when they are flushed down the drains. These also include shampoo and soap scum that gets stuck down the tub drain and the shower drains.
*   **Paper items –** This includes paper towels, tissues, napkins, and disposable cups that are not disposed of properly.

## **How to Clean Clogged Drains at Home**

If you have partially clogged drains, it can be a huge inconvenience and costly to fix. Whether you’re trying to unclog all the gunk from your kitchen drain or the sink in the bathroom, there are some steps you can take to help clean them yourself.

### **Plunger**

This is usually done with a special device that allows you to push the plunger firmly down onto the drain opening and then pull it back up slowly to create suction within the pipe. Be careful not to force anything down there; if you do this gently and carefully, it might do the trick!

### **Baking Soda and White Vinegar**

This DIY drain cleaner is one of the most common ways to clean drains. Simply pour half a cup of baking soda down your drain, followed by half a cup of white vinegar. The chemical reaction between these two will cause foaming action and bubbling sounds, which should help dislodge any clogs that are in there. If you have some time on your hands, let this sit for five minutes before pouring hot water down it.

### **Drain Cleaner**

You can use a drain cleaner to unclog your pipes. This is a chemical-based solution that swells up the clogged material in your drains so it can be flushed out. If you’re using this method, be sure to follow all instructions on the bottle carefully; otherwise, it might not work in your kitchen sink drains.

### **Boiling Water**

If you don’t have the budget at hand for a chemical drain cleaner, boiling water is a simple and effective way to unclog your pipes as well. Simply pour boiling water down the drain and let it sit for a few minutes before flushing with cold water. This should help clear out any clogs that are in there.

## **When Should You Call a Drain Cleaning Service?**

While some DIY solutions can help you unclog a drain, they often don’t address the underlying problem and can actually make things worse by causing more damage than good. For example, pouring chemical cleaners into your toilet or sink might clear out the clog temporarily, but it could also damage your pipes and create new problems down the road. And even if you manage to fix the issue, there’s no guarantee that another clog won’t happen again in the future.

So when should you call a drain cleaning service? Here are some situations where we recommend calling one:

### **Foul Odors Coming from the Drain**

If you notice a foul smell coming from your drain, it could be an indication that something is wrong. If the smell is stronger than usual and doesn’t go away after flushing or using your garbage disposal, then it’s time to call a professional.

### **Slow Drain**

If your drain takes longer than usual to drain, it could be a sign that something is clogging the pipes. You may even notice that water levels rise after flushing or using your garbage disposal. If slow drains happen regularly and seem like a recurring problem, then you should definitely call a professional.

### **Water Damage**

If there’s water damage in your home, such as on walls, floors, ceilings, or furniture, then it could be time for an inspection by a professional. This will help determine what caused the issue and how much repair work needs to be done.
