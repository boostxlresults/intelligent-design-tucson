When it comes to drain cleaning, many homeowners think of it as an unimportant task that can wait until drain issues become severe. However, drain cleaning should preformed regularly, as it is essential to prevent drain clogs and other problems.

In fact, regular drain maintenance can save you time, money, and hassle in the long run. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the possibilities that may happen if you neglect drain cleaning.

## The Consequences of Neglecting Drain Cleaning

If drain cleaning is neglected, it can lead to several problems. Over time, food particles and other debris can accumulate in drain pipes which can cause clogs. If these clogs are not addressed in a timely manner, they may become more difficult to remove, which may lead to the following:

### 1\. Slow Drain Flow

When drain clogs are not addressed, drain pipes may become blocked, and drain flow can slow significantly. This is especially problematic when dealing with sinks, tubs, and showers. Slow drain flow can lead to stagnant water, creating a bacteria breeding ground. This happens when you wash dishes, the drain is slow, bath water doesn’t drain quickly, or dirty dishes pile up in a sink. To prevent this from happening, you can use enzymatic drain cleaners to break down drain clogs. If you are unsure how to do these methods correctly, hiring a professional drain cleaner is best.

### 2\. Bad Smells

Clogged drain pipes can also lead to bad odors coming from the drain, no matter how much you clean or try to cover it up with an air freshener. This happens when food particles and other debris accumulate in drain pipes that start to rot and decay. If you find your drain smelling bad, hire a drain cleaner to clear out the drain.

### 3\. Permanent Drain Damage

If drain clogs are not addressed immediately, it can lead to permanent drain damage. This includes anything from cracked drain pipes to drain pipe corrosion. Drain corrosion doesn’t just occur due to neglect of drain cleaning but also due to drain cleaners that contain too much acid, which can cause corrosion in drain pipes.

It is best to research and choose drain cleaners with the right pH balance or, even better, contact a drain cleaning professional for assistance.

### 4\. Health Risks

Clogged drain pipes can also lead to health risks such as bacteria and mold formation. These are hazardous for the environment and may cause illnesses in people who come into contact with them.

People should take this seriously as the illnesses caused by drain bacteria may range from skin infections to more serious health issues or even death. According to NCBI or the National Library of Medicine, 560,000 people suffer from waterborne diseases each year, proving that drain clogs should not be overlooked.

### 5\. Bad Water Quality

Not cleaning your drain may also lead to bad water quality by incorporating the presence of drain bacteria and mold. When drain pipes are clogged, water that is supposed to go down the drain will seep back into your pipes and, in turn, cause stagnant water, which is a breeding ground for bacteria.

This affects the water quality from taps, making it harmful to drinking or bathing. People with allergies and open wounds may be particularly vulnerable to drain bacteria.

To prevent those problems from occurring, you should have your drain checked by a drain cleaning professional at least twice a year. At Intelligent Design, our drain cleaning team is equipped with the knowledge and professional equipment to unclog drains.

We also offer drain maintenance and sewer cleaning services that help prevent drain clogs from occurring in the long run.

### Tips to Prevent Drain Clogs

It has been said that prevention is better than cure, and drain maintenance should always be a priority. According to drain experts, drain clogs can be prevented by considering the following tips:

*   **Use filters** – You can use drain strainers in sinks and tubs with drain holes to prevent drain clogs. This helps keep food particles and other debris from going down the drain.
*   **Use enzymatic drain cleaners** – Enzymatic drain cleaners are drain cleaners that contain bacteria and enzymes that help break down drain clogs. It is a great way to prevent drain clogs from happening by using them on a regular basis.
*   **Clean the drain regularly** – This means cleaning the drain at least once a month or as needed. You can do this with drain cleaners or a drain snake.
*   **Avoid flushing item** – Never flush items such as sanitary pads, cotton swabs, and wipes down the drain, as these can contribute to draining clogs.
*   **Use drain cleaners with the right pH balance** – drain cleaners that contain too much acid can corrode drain pipes, and this is something you want to avoid.
*   **Call for professional assistance** – If drain clogs happen more often and you are unsure how to do drain cleaning, it is best to hire a drain cleaning professional. It is important to note that drain cleaners should be used with caution as they can affect your drain pipes if not used correctly.
*   **Do not pour oil** – You should never pour oil down the drain as it can create a thick layer that will clog drain pipes. Drain cleaning is an often overlooked yet important task for a healthy and functioning drain system.
*   **Flush your pipes with boiling water** – Flushing drain pipes with boiling water is a great way to prevent drain clogs from happening. This is because hot water helps to melt and drain away any debris, such as grease, oils, and fats, that may have built up inside drain pipes.
*   **Use baking soda** – Baking soda can also help to clean a sink drain. It works by absorbing grease and oils, which may cause build-up.
*   **Don’t use chemical drain cleaners** – Chemical drain cleaners are effective but can also be very corrosive and may harm drain pipes if used in excessive amounts. If you have no choice but to use chemical drain cleaners, make sure you do it cautiously and as instructed.
*   **Use Zip-It Bath and Sink Snare** – These tools remove drain clogs near the drain opening. If you don’t have these tools, it is better to call for professionals as they have the necessary tools you need.
