Drain cleaning is essential to business maintenance, but it is often overlooked. Many business owners don’t think about the consequences of a clogged drain until it’s too late. A clogged drain can cause significant disruptions to your facility and lead to expensive repairs.

One of the most common problems that businesses face is a slow drain. A slow drain is often caused by a build-up of grease, hair, and other debris in the pipes. This build-up can eventually cause the pipe to become blocked, resulting in a clogged drain.

In this article, we will discuss the importance of regular drain cleaning and how to keep your facility running smoothly! Keep reading to learn more!

### What Is Drain Cleaning?

[Drain cleaning](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) is the process of clearing out debris, such as hair, soap scum, and grease, from your drains. This is important because these items can build up over time and cause your drains to become clogged. Clogged drains can lead to many problems, including:

*   Water backups
*   Flooding
*   Slow drain
*   Bad odors
*   Insect infestations
*   Sewer clogs

Drain cleaning is a relatively simple and inexpensive process that can save you a lot of headaches (and money) in the long run.

### How Often Should You Have Your Drains Cleaned?

The frequency with which your drains are cleaned depends on many factors, including your business type, the products you use, how much foot traffic your facility gets, and more. However, we recommend that most businesses have their drains cleaned at least once a year.

If you have a business that uses a lot of water, such as a car wash or restaurant, you may need to have your drains cleaned more often. If you’ve had any recent [plumbing repairs](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/) or installations, it’s also a good idea to have your drains cleaned to ensure that everything is flowing properly.

### Benefits of Regular Drain Cleaning

Having your drains cleaned regularly comes with a host of benefits for businesses. Here are some of the most notable advantages:

*   **Improves the lifespan of your drain**: Regular drain cleaning can help increase your drain’s lifespan. This is because it helps to remove any built-up debris or sediment that could potentially cause damage to the drain over time.
*   **Prevents costly repairs**: Without regular drain cleaning, your business is at risk for more serious and expensive problems. By keeping your drains clean, you can avoid costly repairs and replacements.
*   **Improved hygiene**: One of the main reasons businesses should keep on top of their drain cleaning is for improved hygiene. A build-up of grease, dirt, and bacteria in drains can create a health hazard for employees and customers. Having a regular drain cleaning schedule can help prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and ensure that your premises are safe for everyone.
*   **Eliminate bad odors**: Drain cleaning will remove any build-up in your pipes that is causing bad odors. This is important for businesses because you want customers to have a pleasant experience when they visit your facility.
*   **Reduced chance of flooding**: If you live in an area that experiences a lot of rainfall, you know how important it is to keep your drains clear. If your business’ drainage system becomes backed up, it could lead to flooding in your facility. This can damage equipment and inventory and cause safety hazards for your employees. With regular drain cleaning, you can avoid this problem altogether.

As you can see, there are many reasons why drain cleaning is essential for businesses. Add this service to your maintenance schedule if you want to keep your facility running smoothly and avoid costly repairs.

### 5 Easy DIY Methods to Unclog a Drain

If you’re dealing with a clogged drain, you can try a few simple methods before calling a professional. These DIY techniques may help to break up the clog and get your water flowing again.

#### 1\. Boiling water / Hot water

One of the simplest ways to unclog a drain is by pouring boiling or hot water down the drain. This method works best if the clog is caused by grease or hair. Be careful when using boiling water, as it can damage some types of pipes.

#### 2\. Use a bent wire hanger

Bent wire hangers are a classic tool to unclog a kitchen sink. The wire can help grab and remove things like hair clogs stuck in the sink drain. To use a bent wire hanger, simply straighten the hanger and bend one end into a small hook shape. Insert the hooked end of the hanger into the drain and then move it around to try and grab the clog. Once you have grabbed the clog, pull it out of the drain.

#### 3\. Baking soda and vinegar

Baking soda and vinegar is a natural way to break up clogs without harsh chemicals. You can mix equal parts baking soda and vinegar, pour it down the drain, and let it sit for 30 minutes before flushing with hot water. This DIY drain cleaner is great for small clogs. You don’t always need a harsh chemical drain cleaner for your business.

#### 4\. Plunger

If the sink is still clogged, you can try using a plunger. First, ensure enough water is in the sink to cover the plunger’s cup. Put the plunger over the drain and push and pull it up and down. Be sure to do this quickly so that the pressure created by the plunger can dislodge the clog.

#### 5\. Plumber’s snake

A plumber’s snake is a flexible rod that has a coiled wire at the end. Insert the snake into the drain and push it through until you feel resistance. Then, twist the handle to screw the wire into the clog and pull it out. This method can be effective if done correctly, but if not done correctly, it can damage your pipes.

Commercial drain cleaning is an important part of business maintenance. By keeping your drains clean, you can improve hygiene, eliminate bad odors, and reduce the chance of flooding. If you’re dealing with a clogged drain, there are a few simple DIY methods you can try before calling a professional. But if the clog is severe, it’s best to leave it to the experts.

### Conclusion

Clean drains are the key to a smoothly running facility. By staying on top of your drain cleaning, you can avoid costly repairs and downtime. Your business will run more efficiently, and your customers will be happier.
