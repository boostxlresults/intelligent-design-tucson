Plumbing emergencies should never be ignored. A small problem can quickly turn into a big one, and before you know it, you’re dealing with a full-blown plumbing disaster.

There are many different things that can go wrong with your plumbing throughout your homeownership journey. Some of these problems will be small and easily fixed, while others will be much more serious and require the help of a professional.

In this blog post, we’re going to take a look at nine different plumbing emergencies that you should never ignore. By familiarizing yourself with these problems, you’ll be better prepared to deal with them if they ever arise.

### 1\. Clogged Sinks and Toilets

This is one of the most common plumbing problems that homeowners face. A clogged sink or toilet can be a real nuisance, and if left untreated, it can cause major problems. So don’t ignore it if you notice that your sink or toilet is starting to back up!

Here are a few things you can do to try and clear the clog:

*   Use a plunger to try and dislodge the blockage.
*   Pour some hot water down the drain to melt any grease or soap that may be causing the problem.
*   Use a plumbing snake to reach deep into the drain and break up the clog.

If none of these things work, then it’s time to call a professional.

Clogged toilets are a little bit different than clogged sinks. If your toilet is clogged, you should never try to flush it! This will only make the problem worse. Instead, you’ll need to use a plunger to try and dislodge the clog.

If that doesn’t work, then you can try using a plumbing snake. But if all else fails, it’s time to call in professional plumbing services. A clogged sink or toilet can quickly turn into a major problem, so it’s important to take care of it as soon as possible.

### 2\. Leaky Faucets

Dripping water can lead to stains on your sink or tub, higher water bills, and wasted water. While a single drip may not seem like much, it can actually add up to gallons of water wasted each day.

A faucet that constantly leaks is not only a nuisance, but it’s also a sign that there is a bigger problem. Leaky faucets are often caused by an issue with the washer, O-ring, or packing nut and can usually be fixed relatively easily.

Ignoring a leaky faucet will not make the problem go away, and will only waste more water and money. Tucson plumbers suggest that you fix a leaky faucet as soon as possible.

### 3\. Toilet Overflow

A toilet that overflows is a big problem. Not only is it a mess to clean up, but it can also lead to water damage in your bathroom.

If your toilet is overflowing, you should turn off the water supply immediately and then call a plumber. Do not try to fix the problem yourself, as you could make it worse. Toilet repairs are best left to the professionals.

One thing that is often associated with a toilet overflow is a sewer backup. If you have sewage water backing up into your toilet, it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed immediately by a professional.

### 4\. Water Heater Issues

If you have ever taken a cold shower, you know how important your water heater is. Water heaters typically last around eight to 12 years, but they can start having issues long before they need to be replaced.

Tankless water heaters have a lifespan of about 20 years, so if you have one of these, you probably won’t have to worry about it for a while.

Some common signs that your water heater is not working properly include strange noises, leaks, or no hot water. You should call a plumber right away if you notice any of these issues, as they can often be fixed relatively easily.

A [broken water heater](https://www.idesignac.com/plumber-tucson/water-heaters-tucson/) can cause major flooding in your home, so it is important to get it fixed as soon as possible.

### 5\. Sewer Backup

Sewage backups are one of the most serious plumbing issues, as they can lead to major water damage and even health problems. If you have sewage water backing up into your home, it is important to call a local plumbing contractor immediately.

Here are a few signs that you may have a sewer backup:

*   Water backing up into your toilet, tub, or sink
*   Unusual smells coming from your drains
*   Drains that are slow or completely clogged
*   Gurgling sounds coming from your drains

Sewer repairs can be complicated, so it is important to leave them to professional plumbers. It’s also a good idea to have your sewer cleaned on a regular basis to prevent backups from happening.

### 6\. Burst Pipe

A burst pipe in the home is a plumbing emergency that needs to be fixed immediately. A burst pipe can cause major water damage and even lead to mold growth.

If you have a burst pipe, you should turn off the water supply to your home and then call a full service plumbing company. Once the plumber arrives, they will assess the situation and determine the best course of action.

Freezing temperatures can cause burst pipes, so if you live in an area that gets cold, be sure to take preventive measures to avoid this problem.

### 7\. Rust Build-Up

If you have an older home, you may start to notice that your pipes are rusting. When heavy rust build-up occurs, it can cause your pipes to rupture. If you have rust in your pipes, it’s important to call a Tucson plumbing company right away so they can replace the pipes before they break.

Rust build-up is usually caused by old age, but it can also be caused by water with high iron content. This is dangerous, especially if you drink the water from your tap.

### 8\. Leaking Washing Machine Hose

If you have a washing machine in your home, then you know that there are always a few drops of water left in the hose after each load. However, if you notice that your hose is leaking a lot of water or even spraying water, then this is definitely an emergency. A leaking washing machine hose can quickly lead to flooding and serious water damage.

If you notice a leaking washing machine hose, the first thing you should do is turn off the water to the washing machine. Then, call a plumbing service to come and take a look at it. They will be able to determine what is causing the leak and fix it so your washing machine is safe to use again.

[Plumbing leaks](https://www.idesignac.com/leak-detection/) can be serious, so it’s important never to ignore them. If you have a plumbing leak in your home, the best thing to do is call for a plumbing repair service right away.

### 9\. Sump Pump Failure

A sump pump is a vital part of your home’s plumbing system, as it helps to keep your home dry and free of water damage. The sump pump is a device that is installed at the lowest point of your home, and it pumps water out of your home to prevent flooding.

If your sump pump fails, then you are at risk for flooding and water damage. If you notice that your sump pump is not working properly, or if it has stopped working entirely, then you should call a plumbing service to come and take a look at it.

A power outage usually causes sump pump failure, so if you live in an area prone to power outages, you should have a backup sump pump on hand. You should also ensure that your sump pump is regularly serviced and maintained to prevent this problem.
