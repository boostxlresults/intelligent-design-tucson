You know the frustration of a sluggish or blocked drain if you’ve ever experienced one. If not cleaned correctly, it poses a health risk in addition to being an eyesore. Because of this, it’s crucial to have the necessary equipment to assist you clear the drains.

What is the best way to clear a drain? There are several ways to clear a drain, but the best way will depend on the severity of the blockage. In this post, we will learn about some of the ways that you can clear a drain.

## **The Drain Cleaner You Need for Clogged Drains**

### **Baking Soda and Vinegar**

If you’ve ever had a clogged drain, you know how frustrating it can be. The water build-up can cause all sorts of problems, from foul odors to slow drainage. While there are many drain cleaning products on the market, sometimes the simplest solution is the best.

Baking soda and vinegar are two everyday household items used to clean partially clogged drains. To use this method, simply pour a cup of baking soda down the drain, followed by a cup of vinegar. Next, cover the drain with a plug or rag and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes.

Then, flush the drain with boiling water. This method is safe for most drains and is much less harsh than chemical cleaners. Plus, it’s far cheaper! So next time your drain starts acting up, reach for the baking soda and vinegar before turning to more expensive (potentially harmful) solutions.

### **Aerosol Drain Cleaners**

While many people view drain cleaning as challenging and unpleasant, it is integral to keeping your home’s plumbing system in good working order. Over time, hair, soap scum, and food particles can build up in sink drains, causing them to become clogged.

Aerosol or consol drain cleaners can help to break up these deposits and clear the way for water to flow freely. When used regularly, consol drain cleaners can help to prevent slow drains and keep your plumbing system flowing smoothly.

### **Enzymatic Drain Cleaners**

If you’re dealing with a clogged drain, enzymatic drain cleaners can be a big help. These drain cleaners use natural bacteria and enzymes to break down organic matter, like hair, soap scum, and grease, that can cause sewer clogs.

They’re safe for your pipes and won’t damage your plumbing as a chemical drain cleaner can. They’re usually available at your local hardware store or grocery store. So, an enzyme drain cleaner is an excellent option if you’re looking for a safe and effective way to clean your drains.

In addition, you can also use boiling water to open up slow drains. Simply pour a pot of boiling water down the sink drain and wait a few minutes before flushing it with cold water. This simple treatment can often be enough to dislodge any build-up and restore normal drainage.

### **Standard Tools**

If you’re dealing with a clogged sink or other drains, you may be able to fix the problem without calling a professional. You can often use standard drain-cleaning tools to break up tough clogs and clear blocked drains.

For instance, you can often use a plunger to dislodge more minor clogs. However, if the clog is more stubborn, you may need to use steel grinders or a drain snake. These tools can help to break up the clog and clear the drain.

Of course, in some cases, a professional drain cleaning may be necessary. But if you’re willing to do some work yourself, you may be able to fix the problem without calling in a plumber.

## **Regular Drain Cleaning Prevents Slow Drains**

Have you noticed that your drain drains a little slower than usual? This is a common problem that many homeowners experience from time to time. While it may not seem a big deal, a slow drain can signify a bigger problem.

A slow drain can lead to clogs, backups, and even flooding if left unchecked. The good news is that regular drain cleaning can help to prevent these problems. Regularly opening up your drain and flushing it out with hot water can remove any built-up debris and keep your drains clean and clear.

As a result, you’ll enjoy the benefits of having clean drains – including quicker drainage and fewer clogs. So don’t wait until your drains are slow – schedule regular drain cleaning today!

## **How Often Should You Clean Drains?**

### **For Businesses**

The number of times your drains are cleaned each month is determined by various elements, such as the kind of your company, the goods it sells, the volume of foot traffic it experiences, and other aspects.

On the other hand, we strongly advise the majority of commercial establishments to get their drains cleaned at least once a year. You may need to have your drains cleaned more often if you run a company that requires a significant amount of water, such as a restaurant or car wash.

It is also a good idea to get your drains cleaned if you have recently had any repairs or installations done to your plumbing system. This will guarantee that everything is flowing as it should be.

### **For Homeowners**

For homeowners, it is generally recommended that you have your drains cleaned every year. This will ensure that your drains are clear and working correctly.

If you have a clogged drain, you should try to unclog it yourself with the help of the tools listed above. If the blockage is minor, you may be able to use a plunger or a plumber’s snake to break up the blockage and allow the water to flow through.

However, if the blockage is more severe, you may need to call a professional like iDesign to help you clear the drain.
