In this article, we will discuss eight different drain cleaning methods that plumbers in Tucson can use to unclog your drains. If you’re dealing with a clogged drain, read on!

### Common Causes of Clogged Drains

Before we get into the different drain cleaning methods, let’s quickly discuss some of the most common causes of clogged drains. This way, you can try to avoid these problems in the future. Here are some of the most common causes of clogged drains:

*   **Hair**: This is one of the most common causes of clogged drains. When hair sheds from your head or body, it can easily become tangled in the drain and cause a blockage.
*   **Soap scum**: A common issue in many homes is soap scum, which can quickly build up and cause a clog. Soap scum is made up of grease, oil, and dirt that attaches to the walls of your drain.
*   **Grease**: When grease cools, it can harden and adhere to your pipes. Over time, this build-up will restrict water flow and eventually lead to a clog.
*   **Food scraps**: Food scraps should never go down your sink. Food scraps can build up over time and create a nasty clog. If you have a garbage disposal, be sure to use it properly and dispose of food scraps in the trash.

### Signs That You Need Drain Cleaning Services

Fortunately, there are several warning signs that can indicate that your drains need to be cleaned. If you notice any of the following problems, it’s time to call a professional [plumber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumber):

*   **Slow draining sink** – If water is backing up or taking longer than usual to go down the drain, this is a sure sign of a clog somewhere in the line. Plumbing services can use various methods to unclog the drain and keep things flowing smoothly.
*   **Foul smells coming from the drain** – A bad smell is one of the most common indications that there is a clog somewhere in the pipes. If you notice this, it’s best to call a plumbing company immediately. Foul smells can cause nausea and headaches and can also be a sign of a bigger problem.
*   **Water backing up into other drains** – A clog can cause water to back up into other drains in your home. This severe problem should be addressed immediately by calling a professional plumbing service.
*   **Gurgling sounds** – This usually indicates that your drain is partially clogged. The main sewer line is backed up if you hear gurgling when you flush the toilet.

If you notice any of these signs, it’s time to call [Intelligent Design](https://www.idesignac.com/). Our professional plumbers will assess the situation and determine the best action to take. We have a wide range of drain cleaning methods that we can use to unclog your drains and get them flowing smoothly again.

### 8 Ways Plumbers in Tucson Can Unclog Your Drains

Now that we’ve discussed some of the most common causes of clogged drains and the signs that you need [drain cleaning services](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/), let’s look at eight different ways that Tucson plumbers can unclog your drains.

#### Method #1: Pipe inspection

Most plumbers want to inspect the pipe before starting to work on it. This is because they need to determine the cause of the clog and figure out the best way to fix it. By looking at the pipe, the plumber can see if any blockages need to be removed.

#### Method #2: Pipe cameras

If the plumber suspects that there is a blockage in the pipe, they may use a pipe camera to take a closer look. A pipe camera is a small, high-definition camera that is inserted into the pipe. This allows the plumber to see what’s causing the clog. A plumber will maneuver the camera through the pipe until they reach the blockage. Then, they can determine the best way to remove it.

#### Method #3: Plunger

The plunger is one of the most common tools that a plumber will use to unclog a drain. A plunger works by creating a seal around the drain and then using air pressure to push the clog through the pipe.

To use a plunger, simply place it over the drain and push and pull the handle up and down. The plunger will create suction that will help to break up the clog. If this doesn’t work, there might be a bigger issue causing the clog.

#### Method #4: Manual drain snake

A manual drain snake is a small, hand-held auger that is very useful for clearing minor [plumbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing) issues, such as slow drains, tankless water heaters, leaky faucets, and toilet repairs. It is also very effective at breaking up small blockages in your drain.

To use a manual drain snake, simply insert the auger into the drain and turn the handle to rotate the spiral head of the auger through the blockage. Tucson plumbers will also use a power drain snake for bigger clogs.

#### Method #5: Motorized drain snake

This is a powered version of the hand-operated drain snake. It is a long, thin metal cable with a cutting blade on its end. The plumber inserts the drain snake into the clogged drain and spins it around to cut through the clog. This method is effective for hair clogs and other tough blockages. Plumbing leaks are also repaired with the help of this method.

#### Method #6: Hydro jetting

Affordable plumbing services in Tucson and Green Valley will have a wide range of drain cleaning methods to choose from. One effective yet slightly pricier option is hydro jetting.

This involves using high-pressure water to clean out your drains and remove any blockages. Hydro jetting is especially effective for clearing out grease, hair, and other debris that can build up over time.

#### Method #7: Chemical drain cleaner

A full-service plumbing company will always have a chemical drain cleaner on hand. This is one of the most effective ways to unclog any type of drain. [Chemical drain cleaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_drain_cleaners) are available in both liquid and gel form. Plumbers in Tucson work with these products on a daily basis and know how to use them effectively.

Chemical [drain cleaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drain_cleaner) contain harsh chemicals that can be dangerous if used incorrectly. That is why it is always best to leave this type of work to the professionals. A Tucson plumbing company has the experience and training needed to use these products safely. Plumbers will also have the proper equipment to dispose of the chemicals properly.

#### Method #8: Drain augers

A plumbing repair and sewer repairs company will have several different drain augers on hand to clear out all types of clogs. The type of auger used will be based on the location and severity of the clog. For example, a small handheld auger can be used for a bathroom sink, while a larger truck-mounted auger is needed for main sewer line blockages.

These are just a few ways a professional plumber can unclog your drain. If you are having trouble with a clogged drain, water heater installation, or any other plumbing issue, call us. We are always happy to help!
