### Pipe Lining Explained

Pipe lining is perfect for restoring the cast iron pipes under the slab foundation of your home. It repairs damaged or broken pipes without digging them up.

Pipe lining can be done quickly and efficiently, and it’s much less disruptive than traditional pipe repair methods. Pipe lining is also more effective than traditional methods, because it creates a seamless barrier that prevents roots and other objects from penetrating the pipe.

In addition, pipe lining extends the life of the pipe and can be used to repair pipes that are leaking. If you have a damaged or broken line, pipe lining is an ideal solution.

### Trenchless Pipe Lining in Action

The process begins with a thorough inspection of the existing pipe. Once the damage has been assessed, a new liner is created, slightly smaller than the original pipe.

The liner is then inserted into the existing pipe and inflated. As the liner expands, it presses against the walls of the existing pipe, creating a tight seal. Once the liner has cured, it forms a permanent, watertight bond that can last for decades. Pipe lining is an efficient and cost-effective way to repair damaged pipes without excavating and replacing them entirely.

### Why Consider Pipe Lining?

Pipe lining is perfect for restoring the cast iron pipes under the slab foundation of your home. These are some of the benefits of pipe lining:

*   This will save you money in the long run by avoiding replacement and getting new pipes.
*   Pipe lining will increase the flow of water in your pipes, saving you money on your water bill.
*   Pipe lining is a much faster and less disruptive process than pipe replacement, so you can get back to your normal routine quickly.
*   You can avoid excavating your yard, which can be costly and time-consuming.
*   Quieter installation.

### Pipe Lining vs. Repiping

Some people get confused when trying to figure out pipe lining versus repiping. They differ in a few key ways. Here’s the breakdown :

#### Process:

In the world of piping, there are two main methods for repairing damaged or outdated pipes – repiping and pipe lining. As their names suggest, repiping involves completely replacing your existing pipe system, while pipe lining involves repairing your existing pipes.

When it comes to time consumption, pipe lining is a much quicker process than repiping. Pipe lining can typically be completed in just a few hours, while repiping can take days or even weeks. In addition, pipe lining is less disruptive than repiping, as it can be completed without tearing up your floors or walls. As a result, pipe lining is the clear winner due to speed and convenience

#### Cost:

Pipe lining and repiping are two very different approaches to repairing pipes. Pipe lining is much more cost-effective than repiping, but the cost may vary depending on a few factors. The severity of the damage, the length of the pipe, and more all play a role.

Pipe lining is the more affordable option, and it’s also less invasive. Repiping is essentially starting from scratch, which can get quite costly. If you’re looking to repair your pipes without breaking the bank, pipe lining is the way to go!

#### Materials:

When it comes to materials, pipe lining uses various pipe materials, including PVC and HDPE, which are more affordable. On the other hand, repiping often uses copper pipe, which is a more expensive material. Pipe lining also has a wide range of pipe materials to choose from, so you can find the perfect fit for your needs and budget.

### Signs You Need Pipe Lining

If you’re not sure if your pipes need pipe lining, here are the common symptoms of deteriorating sewer drains:

*   Slow or gurgling drains
*   Sewer backups or blockages
*   Slow draining toilets
*   Water spilling out from around your pipe joints
*   Moldy or discolored walls
*   Sewage odor
*   Corroded pipes

### Leading Pipe Lining Equipment

*   Inversion machines

### The Process You Can Expect

Our pipe lining process is designed to be as seamless as possible for our customers. Here’s what you can expect from us:

### Conducting Pipe Assessment

The first step is to conduct a pipe assessment to determine the condition of your pipes. We start with a complete camera inspection of your sewer pipes, locating the problem, and determining the best solution. This is essential to catch any tiny cracks or blockages that may be present.

### Inserting the Liner

Once your pipes have been properly assessed and cleaned, we’ll insert the new pipe liner into your pipe. We will inflate the lining material to create a snug fit against the pipe walls.

This process is repeated until the epoxy resin adopts the form of the old pipe. The pipe lining material is then allowed to cure before being put into service. This pipe lining material is durable and will last for many years, helping to preserve your pipe investment.

### Curing the Lining Material With Air Pressure

Once the pipe lining material is in place, we will cure the liner using air pressure. Hydro jetting is our most reliable method of drain cleaning that uses pressurized water to remove the most stubborn clogs, including calcified minerals and tree roots.

The pressure of the water used during the hydro jetting process is controlled by our team and will never damage your pipes. This helps to eliminate your pipe corrosion problems and create a seamless pipe that will last for years to come.

### Final Inspection

Once the pipe lining is cured, we will perform tests to check the new pipe’s strength and ensure that we installed it correctly. This process is essential but straightforward; we want to make sure that the pipe lining has properly bonded to the pipe so that there are no weak spots or leaks.

We will also check to see that the pipe has been properly cleaned and cleared of debris. Finally, we will test the water flow through the pipe to ensure that it is up to code. Once the final inspection is complete, you can rest assured that your pipes are in good condition and will continue to function properly for years to come.
