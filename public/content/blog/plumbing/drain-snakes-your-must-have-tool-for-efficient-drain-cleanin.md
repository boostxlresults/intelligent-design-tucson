Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of time and money it takes to keep your drains clean? You’re not alone. Clogged pipes can be tricky to resolve, but there’s one tool that every homeowner should have available: drain snakes! These handy gadgets are designed for effective yet efficient [drain cleaning](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-and-sewer/drain-cleaning-tucson/) to save you both time and money in the long run. Read on to learn more about how to use a drain snake for all-natural pipe maintenance so you won’t have to call out an expensive plumber for help!

## **What is a Drain Snake?**

A drain snake is a long, flexible tool that’s inserted into the pipes and drains of your home to clear out any obstruction. Typically made from metal or plastic, the hollow tube has a coiled wire at one end which – when spun around inside the pipe – helps to break apart and remove any debris such as food particles, hair, dirt, soap scum, and more. Drain snakes come in a variety of sizes and shapes so you can use them for all kinds of drain maintenance tasks, from unclogging toilets to clearing out bathtub drains.

## **The Importance of Using a Drain Snake**

Using a drain snake is one of the best ways to unclog your pipes without having to resort to harsh, chemical-filled cleaners. Not only are these cleaners ineffective in many cases, but they can also cause damage to your plumbing system and even emit harmful fumes into the air. By investing in a quality drain snake, you’ll be able to use it to get the job done without any of these negative side effects.

## **Benefits of Using a Drain Snake**

Using a drain snake comes with several benefits:

*   **Cost-Effective**: One of the biggest advantages is that drain snakes are relatively inexpensive compared to hiring a professional plumber.
*   **Easy to Use:** Drain snakes are designed for easy operation, even if you don’t have any plumbing experience.
*   **Effective:** Drain snakes can easily break apart and remove any debris or blockages in your pipes, so you won’t have to worry about clogged drains again.
*   **Environmentally Friendly:** Since you won’t be using any harsh chemicals or cleaners, it’s also better for the environment too!

## **How to Use a Drain Snake Effectively**

Dealing with a clogged drain can be a frustrating experience, but a drain snake, also known as a plumbing snake or auger, can be a powerful tool to help you clear the blockage and get the water flowing freely again. Whether you’re a homeowner or a renter, knowing how to use a drain snake effectively can save you time and money by avoiding the need for a professional plumber. Follow this step-by-step guide to tackle drain clogs with confidence:

### **Step 1: Gather Your Materials**

Before you begin, gather the necessary materials and equipment:

1.  **Drain Snake**: Purchase or rent a suitable drain snake from your local hardware store. Opt for a handheld manual drain snake for most household clogs.
2.  **Protective Gear**: Wear gloves to protect your hands and safety goggles to shield your eyes from any splashes.
3.  **Bucket and Rags**: Keep a bucket and some old rags nearby to catch any debris that comes out of the drain.

### **Step 2: Remove Debris from the Surface**

Clear any visible debris, hair, or gunk from the surface of the drain. This step will help the drain snake navigate through the pipe more easily and prevent it from getting caught on larger obstructions.

### **Step 3: Insert the Drain Snake**

Carefully insert the drain snake into the drain opening. For tubs and sinks, this is usually the overflow or main drain opening. For toilets, insert the snake through the toilet bowl, not the tank.

### **Step 4: Work the Drain Snake**

Once the snake is inserted, start turning the handle clockwise. The snake will begin to move down the drain. Keep feeding the snake in while turning the handle, ensuring it goes deeper into the pipe.

### **Step 5: Feel for Resistance**

As you work the drain snake down the pipe, you may encounter some resistance. This could indicate a clog. Keep turning the handle, but be gentle to avoid damaging the pipe.

### **Step 6: Break Through the Clog**

When you encounter the clog, you may feel a sudden resistance followed by a give. This indicates that the snake has broken through the blockage. Continue to turn the handle and push the snake further to ensure it completely clears the clog.

### **Step 7: Retract the Drain Snake**

Once you’ve cleared the clog, slowly retract the drain snake by turning the handle counterclockwise. Make sure to clean the snake as you pull it out to avoid transferring debris to other areas.

### **Step 8: Test the Drain**

With the clog removed, test the drain by running water. Check if the water flows freely without any backup or slow drainage. If the issue persists, you may need to repeat the process or consider seeking professional assistance.

### **Step 9: Clean and Store the Drain Snake**

Thoroughly clean the drain snake after each use to remove any residue or debris. Rinse it with water and use a disinfectant if necessary. Once clean, store the drain snake in a dry and safe place for future use.

### **Pro Tips:**

*   For stubborn clogs, you can use a drain cleaning product before using the drain snake. However, avoid mixing different chemicals, as they may react and create harmful fumes.
*   If you encounter excessive resistance or are unable to clear the clog, it’s best to stop and call a professional plumber to avoid causing further damage to the plumbing system.
*   Regularly maintain your drains by using drain covers or strainers to catch hair and larger particles, preventing future clogs.

By following this step-by-step guide, you can effectively use a drain snake to tackle the most common drain clogs around your home. Remember to exercise patience and caution during the process, and don’t hesitate to seek professional help if needed.

## **When to Call a Professional Plumber**

Although drain snakes are an effective tool for clearing out most clogs, there may be times when the issue is beyond the scope of a DIY approach. If you encounter any of the following situations, it’s best to call a professional plumber:

*   The clog is too deep in the pipe and your drain snake can’t reach it.
*   You find that the obstruction is too large for your drain snake to break through.
*   Your pipes have become damaged while using the drain snake.
*   The clog isn’t clearing after multiple attempts with a drain snake.

Having an experienced plumber on call can be invaluable in these situations, as they’ll be able to use specialized tools and techniques to identify and clear any blockages. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, so when in doubt, contact a licensed plumbing expert.

By using drain snakes regularly and following the tips above, you can ensure your drains stay clog-free and work properly for years to come!
