If your home’s [plumbing](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/) system has reached the end of its lifespan or shows signs of wear and tear, repiping it with copper pipes may be the best solution. Replacing the old piping in your home can improve your water pressure, ensure a safe water supply, reduce noise in the pipes, and even save money on energy bills. 

However, repiping can be a big job, so it’s essential to make sure that you hire a reputable repiping contractor. In this post, we’ll provide tips for finding repiping professionals who can do the job right.

## Do Your Research

The best way to find a reputable contractor is to do your research. You may ask friends and family who have hired repiping contractors before and ask who they recommend. You may also check the output of the contractor by visiting your friend’s or relative’s houses and see how well their repiping projects turned out. By doing this, you can get a feel for the contractors’ workmanship and quality of service.

## Do Your Homework

Once you’ve found a few repiping contractors, do some research on each one of them. Look at their website to see what kind of services they offer and what projects they’ve completed. You should also check out reviews by other customers who have hired these companies in the past.

## Ask for References

Before hiring a repiping contractor:

1.  Make sure they have references from previous customers. You can ask for their project portfolio or for the contractor to provide you with a list of references.
2.  Make sure you call these references and ask them about their experience with the repiping contractor.
3.  Don’t be afraid to ask about any problems they may have had and how the contractor handled them.
4.  Ask if they would hire this repiping contractor again.

## Ask for Bonding and Insurance

The plumbing company should be bonded and insured. This means they are responsible for any damages they may cause to your property while on the job. The company should also have workers’ compensation insurance to cover injuries their employees suffer while working on your project. Failure to have these insurance policies is a sure sign that the company is not legitimate and should be avoided.

## Get a Quote

When you’re looking for reputable repiping contractors, be sure to consider how much they will charge. You may want to find out if they offer to finance as well. Some plumbing companies will offer financing as an option, so you can pay in installments rather than all at once. 

The interest rate on these loans is usually relatively low, and the payments are flexible, allowing you to have a little more money in your budget each month. If you’re worried about having enough cash for the repairs or installation after reading how expensive it can be, take advantage of these options!

## Read the Contract Carefully

Before signing a repiping contract, make sure that you read it carefully and understand what is included in the agreement. Pay close attention to hidden fees or charges, such as permit fees or materials costs.

If any details are unclear or confusing, don’t hesitate to ask questions. A reputable repiping contractor will be more than happy to answer any questions.

These are just a few tips to help you find reputable repiping contractors. By hiring our repiping contractors at Intelligent Design, you can rest assured that we possess all the qualities of a reputable repiping contractor and can help you repipe your home more safely and efficiently.

## What Should You Look for in Reputable Repiping Contractors

When it comes time to repipe your home, you want to make sure that you hire a repiping contractor who will not only do the job correctly but also work within your budget. Here are some of the qualities and characteristics that you should look for when evaluating repiping contractors:

*   **Experience:** Make sure that the repiping contractor you choose has ample experience in repiping residential and commercial buildings. An experienced repiping contractor will know the best methods for repiping and installing the new plumbing systems to ensure that it is done correctly and safely.
*   **Professionalism:** A professional repiping contractor should be knowledgeable, courteous, and willing to answer your questions. They should also be up-to-date on the latest repiping technology and materials in order to provide you with the best possible repiping job.
*   **Certifications:** Repiping contractors must have credentials from the appropriate repiping associations. This will show that they are qualified to repipe your home safely and correctly.
*   **Offers Wide Services:** A repiping contractor should be able to provide a wide range of repiping and plumbing services. This includes copper piping, installing a new repiping system, repairing a broken plumbing line, and pumping a sewer or septic system. They should also have experience with a variety of piping materials, such as lead pipes, galvanized steel, and PEX pipes.
*   **Good Reputation:** Make sure you look for repiping contractors with good reputations in the area. If they have a good online presence and many positive customer reviews, this is usually a sign that they are reputable repiping contractors.

By doing your research and finding a repiping contractor with all these qualities, you can ensure that the repiping project is done correctly and safely.

## Important Things To Do After Repiping

After you have read all the steps in repiping, you may call repiping contractors and repipe your home. But let us give you some advice to do once repiping has been completed. This is to ensure that everything is functioning efficiently and there are no hidden issues that might cause you problems down the line. Here are some important things to do after repiping:

*   **Inspect the repiping job:** After repiping is complete, it’s important to inspect the repiping job and make sure that everything has been installed correctly. Ask the repiping contractor for a copy of their inspection checklist so you can check off each item as you go along.
*   **Test all fixtures:** Once repiping has been completed, you’ll want to test all of the plumbing fixtures in your home. This includes toilets, showers, sinks, and any other water outlets. Make sure that everything is functioning properly and that there are no leaks or moisture damage.
*   **Check the water pressure:** The repiping process should have improved your home’s water pressure—if it hasn’t, you may need to check the pipes for any obstructions that might be causing a blockage. Also, if your repiping was done with CVPC pipes, you may consider adding an inline water pressure regulator to ensure that your water pressure is at optimal levels.
*   **Perform regular maintenance:** Regular maintenance is essential for repiping systems, especially if you have galvanized steel pipes. Though durable, galvanized steel is prone to corrosion, the number one cause of leaks. So make sure to check for any leaks or blockages, inspect the pipes and fittings periodically, and flush out the system every few months. Doing so will help you get the most out of your [repiping](https://www.idesignac.com/plumber-tucson/repipe-specialist-tucson/) work and ensure that it lasts as long as possible.
