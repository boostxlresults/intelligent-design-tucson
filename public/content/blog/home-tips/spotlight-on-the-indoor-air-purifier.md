### Intelligent Design IAQ

More than 150 years ago, Florence Nightingale—a pioneering founder of modern nursing—believed that it was essential to design buildings in a way that allowed sunlight to filter inside. Her reasoning was that sunlight helps kill germs and improves the health of the occupants. Recently, her theory was proven correct. Sunlight does indeed kill germs, including viruses and bacteria. Unfortunately, the effects of sunlight inside buildings are also unreliable, as windows tend to filter out ultraviolet (UV) rays. The solution is the indoor air purifier, available for installation from Intelligent Design of Tucson.

### The Risks of Poor Indoor Air Quality

Did you know that the air inside your home is often more heavily contaminated than the outdoor air? This is true even if you live in an urban area. Furthermore, since the pandemic has necessitated staying at home as much as possible, the air quality in your home has likely taken a turn for the worse. There are some simple ways to improve the air quality in your home, such as regular carpet cleaning. Poor indoor air quality has been scientifically linked to numerous health problems. If your air is contaminated by airborne pollutants, the following issues could result:

*   Headaches
*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness
*   Irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat
*   Worsening allergy symptoms
*   More frequent and severe asthma attacks

Certain indoor air contaminants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have even been linked to internal organ damage and certain cancers. Thus, all homes can benefit from having an indoor air purifier and routine replacements of home air filters.

### Our Recommended Indoor Air Purifier

Here at Intelligent Design, we strongly recommend the Respicaire PCO Max AirSterilizer®. This indoor air purifier brings advanced aerospace technology directly into your home at an affordable price point. The Respicaire system uses a magnetic base and an active ionic air scrubber. The air scrubber relies on ultraviolet (UV) light, which is the same type of cleansing light emitted by the sun. It also uses catalytic reactions to create airborne oxidizers, which are then sent out to circulate on the airflow throughout your home.

These airborne oxidizers seek out and destroy harmful microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and mold spores. What’s more, the oxidizers can even reduce unpleasant odors and dangerous volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). As a result, you and your family can enjoy cleaner, healthier indoor air all year-round.

Plus, the Respicaire system does not require much maintenance. All that’s needed is the once per year replacement of the UV purifying lamp, as well as periodic replacement of the spiroplate.
