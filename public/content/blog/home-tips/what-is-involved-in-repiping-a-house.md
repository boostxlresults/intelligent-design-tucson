In this blog post, we’ll outline the steps involved in repiping a house. We’ll also provide some tips on how to choose a reputable repiping contractor. So if you’re thinking about replacing your home’s [plumbing](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/), read on for more information!

## What is Repiping?

Repiping is the process of replacing or installing pipes in an existing water supply or plumbing system. It includes both interior and exterior piping, as well as all fixtures and valves that direct the flow of water into your home. Repiping a house can be necessary for a variety of reasons including corrosion issues due to age leaks from broken pipes, or to upgrade the water supply system.

Repiping can also be done if you wish to change or improve upon existing fixtures and piping, or if you want your home’s plumbing system to be compliant with local codes. Whatever the reason may be, repiping a house is an important task that should not be taken lightly. A sewer or septic system should also be evaluated by a professional before any repiping work. Plumbing systems can be complicated, so it is important to understand the scope of the project before starting.

### Reasons to Repipe Your Home

Repiping is more than just replacing a few pipes here and there. It requires careful planning and expertise to ensure that the job is done properly. But why would you want to [repipe your home](https://www.idesignac.com/7-benefits-of-repiping-your-tucson-home/) in the first place? There are several reasons why this might be necessary:

*   **You have low water pressure** – If you are noticing that your water pressure has dropped, it may be due to the pipes becoming clogged or corroded. Repiping can help remove the blockages and restore your water pressure to its former glory. Lead pipes can be especially prone to clogging and should be replaced as soon as possible.
*   **You see slab or pinhole leaks** – Slab and pinhole leaks are a sign that the pipes in your home are aging and need to be replaced. Slab leaks are when a pipe starts leaking from inside the slab, which can cause major damage to your foundation. Pinhole leaks occur when small holes form in the pipes due to corrosion or mineral buildup. Both types of leaks require professional attention and may involve repiping your entire house. The piping materials used for repiping will depend on the type of home and the extent of the damage.
*   **Discolored or contaminated water** – If your tap water has a strange color or odor, it may be contaminated and need to be replaced. This is often due to corrosion in the pipes that can cause lead and other contaminants to leach into the water supply. Repiping can help ensure that you have clean, safe drinking water in your home. Copper pipes are becoming increasingly popular, as they are not susceptible to corrosion and can help keep contamination out of your water.
*   **You live in an older home** – Older homes typically have galvanized steel pipes or iron pipes that can degrade over time and become prone to clogs and leaks. Repiping your home with copper or PEX pipes (cross-linked polyethylene) is a good way to avoid any future problems due to an aging pipe system. The old plumbing system should be completely replaced, rather than just patching it up with new parts.
*   **Your copper piping is aging** – The average life expectancy of copper piping is between 20 and 50 years. If your home was built before 1980, it’s likely time for you to consider repiping. Copper pipes can become corroded over time due to water pressure, acidity levels, and mineral content in the water supply. Signs of old or corroded copper piping include discolored or smelly water, low water pressure, and plumbing fixtures that have started to leak.

These are just a few of the reasons why you may need to repipe your home. Sometimes, however, it’s best to be proactive and repipe your home before any of these problems arise. This can help save you time, money, and hassle in the long run.

### The Process of Repiping a House

Repiping a house is no easy feat. It requires the expertise of highly trained professionals and can be a costly endeavor. However, it’s an essential part of protecting the integrity of your home and family. Here are all the steps involved in repiping a house:

**1\. Obtaining Permits and Inspections**

Before any repiping can begin, building permits must be obtained and approved. This process involves inspections from local authorities to ensure the job is done properly. Existing pipes will also be inspected to determine the scope of work required.

**2\. Accessing the Plumbing System**

To access the plumbing system, areas may need to be opened up and drywall removed. Accessing pipes in crawl spaces or attics is often necessary to complete a repiping job properly. [Plumbing issues](https://www.idesignac.com/what-are-the-most-common-plumbing-issues-in-homes/) can occur anywhere in the house, so it’s important to gain access to all necessary areas when repiping.

**3\. Disconnecting Old Pipes**

The old pipes must be disconnected from the existing plumbing system. This includes disconnecting any water heaters, draining the piping system, and then cutting out old sections of the pipe. If you’re using a different type of piping system, such as copper or PEX pipe tubing, special tools may be required to ensure the job is done properly.

**4\. Installing New Pipes**

Once the old pipes have been disconnected, the new pipes can be installed. This requires measuring and cutting the pipe to exact lengths, as well as soldering joints between each section of piping. It’s important to make sure that you have enough piping for the entire job so you don’t run out in the middle of installation.

**5\. Connecting Appliances to the System and Making Necessary Adjustments**

Once the new pipes have been installed, all appliances, such as toilets and sinks, must be reconnected to the system. The pressure and temperature of the water should also be checked to make sure it’s optimal for use in your home.

**6\. Final Testing and Inspection**

Before the job is declared complete, final testing and inspection must be done to make sure that everything has been installed properly. This includes pressure tests to check for water leaks and flow rate tests to ensure that the new pipes can handle the volume of water being used in your home.

#### Final Thoughts

Repiping a house is no small task. It requires the skill and expertise of professionals to ensure that it’s done properly. With all the steps involved, it’s important to make sure you have the right team in place before beginning any repiping job.

If done correctly, however, repiping can be a great way to ensure your home’s plumbing system is up-to-date and functioning optimally.
