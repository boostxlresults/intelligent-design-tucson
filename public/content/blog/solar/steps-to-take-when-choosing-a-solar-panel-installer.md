We all know that solar panels can help save on energy costs, but what’s often overlooked is the importance of choosing a qualified installer. A poorly installed solar panel system can not only be a waste of money, but it can also pose a safety hazard.

In this article, we’ll cover some of the steps you should take when choosing a solar panel installer. If you’re looking to go solar, here are a few important things to consider.

## Why Solar Energy is a Great Choice for Homeowners and Businesses?

[Solar energy](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/) is an excellent choice for homeowners and businesses looking to reduce their environmental footprint. Solar panels are becoming increasingly popular as more people become aware of the potential benefits they offer, including reduced electricity costs, lower maintenance costs, and even tax credits in some areas.

With solar energy, there’s no need for fossil fuels or other sources of energy. Solar panels capture and convert the sun’s energy into electricity, which can be used to power devices, appliances, and electrical systems in homes or businesses. Not only is solar power renewable, but it also produces no emissions while generating electricity.

This means that you can use solar power without impacting the environment. Solar energy is becoming increasingly affordable and easy to install, making it a great choice for homeowners and businesses looking to reduce their energy costs.

Solar panels come in different shapes, sizes, and types, so it’s important to do your research before deciding on the best system for you. Only highly efficient solar panels should be considered for installation, so you don’t waste money on a system that won’t meet your needs.

### Why Choosing the Right Solar Installer is Important

Having your solar panels installed by a qualified and experienced solar installer is essential to ensure you get the most out of your new system. Here are the Top 4 explanations for why choosing the right installer is so crucial.

*   **Quality of work** – Having a qualified installer means you’ll get the highest-quality installation. They will be able to ensure your panels are installed safely, securely, and in compliance with all applicable codes and standards. Solar panel installation companies should also guarantee their work and be able to answer any questions you have about the installation process.
*   **Workmanship warranty** – Solar panel installers are usually backed by a workmanship warranty, which means you’ll be protected financially if there are any problems down the line. This gives you peace of mind that your installation will be done correctly and will last for years to come.
*   **Bankability** – Solar companies that employ certified installers are more likely to be approved by banks and other lending institutions. That’s because they have a proven track record of good work, which makes them stand out when trying to secure financing for solar projects.
*   **Dishonesty** – Solar panel installation company scams are not uncommon. Choosing a certified installer means you can rest assured that the company is honest and reliable. Solar industry certification programs help verify that the installer is reputable and trustworthy, which saves you time, money, and headache.

Knowing the importance of finding a qualified solar installer can help you make an informed decision and ensure your system is installed properly. Solar system installation is a big investment, so make sure you do your research and choose the right installer for your needs.

### Steps to Take When Choosing a Solar Panel Installer

Now that you understand why it’s important to choose a qualified solar panel installer, here are some steps you can take to ensure you select the right one for your project.

**Credentials**

First, check the credentials of any installer you’re considering. Make sure they are licensed, insured, and have the appropriate certifications in your state or municipal area. Many installers may advertise their services but lack the qualifications necessary to do a professional job. Solar energy systems are an important investment and should be installed by someone qualified for the job.

**Credibility and expertise**

It’s also important to choose an installer that is credible and has the expertise necessary to complete your project. Ask for references from previous customers and do research online to learn more about each potential candidate.

You should make sure they have a good track record of completing solar energy projects on time and within budget. It’s also wise to inquire about their experience in the industry. The best solar companies will have years of experience in the field.

**Transparency**

Transparency is key when choosing a solar panel installer. You want to be sure that the company you choose has clear and accessible information about its services, including warranties and licensing. Ask for detailed quotes from multiple companies before deciding so you can compare your options.

A solar energy system is a major financial investment, so it’s important to make sure you are comfortable with the terms and conditions of any agreements before signing.

**Addressing roof conditions**

Solar installation requires an inspection of your roof to ensure it is in good condition and suitable for solar energy systems. Ask potential installers about their procedures for inspecting roofs, as well as what types of repairs may need to be done before installation can begin.

Solar photovoltaic installers should be aware of roofing material types, roof slopes, and other considerations that can affect the installation process.

**Reputation and testimonials**

Solar panel companies should have a good reputation in the industry and positive customer testimonials. You can also check online reviews of the company’s past installations or ask for references from their previous customers.

Reviews and testimonials are an excellent way to get a better understanding of how reliable, knowledgeable, and trustworthy the company is in its services. Intelligent Design is proud to have many positive reviews from both commercial and residential customers.

**Talk to friends and neighbors**

Solar installation company referrals from friends or neighbors are a great way to find a qualified installer. Ask around in your community and see if anyone has had experience with solar installers in the area.

Don’t forget to ask about their experience with customer service, installation quality, and more. Solar panel installations can vary greatly from company to company, so getting a trusted opinion is key.

**Pricing**

Solar photovoltaic installer pricing varies significantly from company to company, so it’s important to shop around and compare quotes before making your decision. Many installers will offer financing options or discounts for certain types of projects. Make sure you understand the costs associated with your solar energy system installation, including any incentives or rebates you may be eligible for. Solar equipment costs have dropped dramatically in recent years, so don’t be afraid to ask for the best possible price.

How many solar panels do you need, and how much will each panel cost? Is the installer offering incentives or other discounts that could help you save money over time? Also, be sure to find out what kind of warranty coverage is included in the price.

Many installers offer a manufacturer’s warranty for products they install, as well as their workmanship warranty. Make sure you understand exactly what is covered and for how long to protect your investment.
