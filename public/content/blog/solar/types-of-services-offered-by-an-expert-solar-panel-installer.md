## What is a Solar Panel Installer?

A solar panel installer is someone who specializes in the installation of residential and/or commercial photovoltaic (PV) systems. The installer will typically assess the environment, determine what type of system is needed, install the panels on a roof or other suitable location, connect them to the power grid, and maintain them for optimal performance. Solar panel installers must have a thorough understanding of electrical wiring, and will often need to obtain certification from a local or state authority.

They are knowledgeable about the associated risks, such as potential fire hazards, and take safety precautions when working with electricity. In some cases, an installer may also be involved in other aspects of solar energy installation, such as connecting the system to the building’s power supply, installing inverters and other electrical components, or providing maintenance service. By using an experienced installer, homeowners can rest assured that their solar energy system is being properly installed and operated for maximum efficiency.

## Types of Services Offered by an Expert Solar Panel Installer

These can range from basic presentations about the technology to more in-depth lectures about financial incentives and how to maximize your savings through a well-installed system. Solar systems are a long-term investment, so it’s important to understand all the information you can before deciding on what system and installer best fit your needs.
