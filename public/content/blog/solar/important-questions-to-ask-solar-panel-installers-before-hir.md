Are you considering solar panels for your home? If so, you’ll want to be sure to hire a qualified solar panel installer. There are many solar panel installers to choose from, so it’s important to ask the right questions before making a decision. This blog post will list questions that you should ask solar panel installers and solar photovoltaic installers before hiring them. Solar panel installers should be able to answer these questions. If they can’t, you might want to consider another installer.

### 1\. How Long Have You Been in Business Installing Solar Panels?

You’ll want to make sure that the solar panel installers you’re considering have experience installing solar panels. Solar installation companies should have at least five years of experience installing solar panels.

Solar panel installers with experience are more likely to be up-to-date on the latest solar panel technology and installation techniques. They’re also more likely to have established relationships with suppliers, which can save you money.

### 2\. What Solar Incentives Are Available in My Area?

Solar incentives are programs offered by state and local governments to encourage homeowners to switch to solar power. These incentives can significantly reduce the cost of solar panel installations. Solar companies should be familiar with the solar incentives available in your area and how they can save you money.

Incentives vary by state and locality, so it’s important to ask about what’s available where you live. Solar panel installers should also be able to tell you how the solar incentive program works and what paperwork is required to apply for the incentives.

### 3\. Are You Licensed, Bonded, and Insured?

Solar panel installers are required to be licensed, bonded, and insured in most states. Bonding protects homeowners from shoddy workmanship or fraud. Solar panel installers who are bonded have a third-party guarantee that they will complete the job according to the terms of their contract. Solar panel installers who are insured have insurance that covers damage to your property during the installation process.

It’s essential to make sure solar panel installers are licensed, bonded, and insured. This protects you in case of any accidents or problems that may occur during the installation process.

### 4\. How Does Your Solar Installation Integrate With The Utility Grid?

Solar panel installers should be able to explain how your solar installation will work with the utility grid. Solar power is a clean and renewable energy source, but it’s also intermittent.

When your panels are generating more electricity than you need, the excess can be sent to the utility grid. This is called net metering, and it helps to offset the cost of your solar panels.

An expert solar installer will know the codes in your area and understand what is required to meet them and how to have them inspected. They should even be able to give you an approximate timeline for this.

### 5\. How Do Your Company Warranties Work?

Solar panel systems are a big investment, so you want to be sure that your installer offers a strong warranty in case anything goes wrong. Be sure to ask about the length of the warranty, what it covers, and what the process is for making a claim.

Getting solar panels installed is a great way to go green and save money on your energy bills. But before you sign on the dotted line, be sure to ask your potential installer these important questions. By doing your homework, you can be confident that you’re choosing the best company to handle your [solar panel installation](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/panel-and-installation-cost-tucson/).

### 6\. Will You Install the Panels, or a Subcontractor?

It’s important to know who will physically install the solar panels on your roof. Solar panel installers may use subcontractors to do the work or have their own in-house installation crew.

If solar panel installers use subcontractors, be sure to ask about their qualifications and experience. Solar panel installation is a complex process, and you want to be sure that the people installing your panels are qualified and experienced.

### 7\. Do You Have Home Solar Installation References?

When you’re considering solar panel installers, be sure to ask for references. A reputable company should be able to provide you with a list of satisfied customers who have had solar panels installed on their homes.

Asking for references is a great way to get first-hand information about the quality of a solar panel installer’s work. Follow up with references and ask them about their experience with the solar panel installer.

### 8\. Who Do We Call If There’s a Problem?

There should be a local person or team that you can contact if there are any problems with your system after it’s installed. The last thing you want is to wait weeks for someone to come out and fix a problem. Be sure to get the name and contact information of someone who will be able to help you if there are any issues.

Ask about the warranty on the solar panels and inverters. Most solar panels have a 25-year warranty, but the inverter usually has a shorter warranty of around five to 10 years.
