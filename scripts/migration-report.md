**Problem:** Some original WordPress URLs were very long  
**Resolution:** Created cleaner, more concise slugs while preserving SEO value  
**Impact:** Positive - improved URL structure

**Resolution:** Estimated dates based on content context and sitemap data  
**Impact:** Minimal - dates are reasonable approximations
