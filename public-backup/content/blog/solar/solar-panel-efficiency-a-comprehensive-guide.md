**What is Solar Panel Efficiency?**

Think of solar panel efficiency as the ability of a panel to turn sunlight into electricity. The better it is at this job, the more energy you get, even with fewer panels.

High-Efficiency vs. Low-Efficiency Panels

Got limited roof space? No worries! High-efficiency panels are great at squeezing more electricity out of every square foot, making them a perfect fit.

### Benefits of High-Efficiency Solar Panels
