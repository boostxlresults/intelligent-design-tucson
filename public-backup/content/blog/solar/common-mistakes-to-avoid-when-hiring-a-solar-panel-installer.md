The popularity of solar panels has skyrocketed over the past few years, and it’s no wonder why. Not only do they help to reduce our carbon footprint, but they also save money on electricity bills in the long run. However, when it comes to installing solar panels, choosing the right installer is crucial. 

Hiring an inexperienced or unlicensed installer could result in a faulty installation, potentially dangerous and costly to fix. To help you avoid these pitfalls, here are some common mistakes to avoid when hiring a solar panel installer.

## **The Growing Popularity of Solar Panels**

Solar power is renewable energy generated from the sun’s rays. It involves using solar panels to capture the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity that can be used to power homes, businesses, and other buildings. The solar industry has seen significant growth in recent years, with many solar panel installation companies and the best solar companies offering [solar systems and solutions](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/). 

One of the biggest reasons behind the growing popularity of solar panels is their cost-effectiveness. The cost of solar panels has dropped significantly over the years, making them more affordable for homeowners and businesses. Additionally, solar panels can help you save money on your electricity bill by reducing your reliance on the grid.

## **The Power Behind the Solar Panels**

Solar power uses solar panels comprising photovoltaic cells to capture the sun’s energy and convert it into electricity. These solar panels can be installed on rooftops, ground-mounted systems, or walls.

The electricity generated by these solar panels can be used to power homes and businesses, and any excess energy can be fed back into the grid for others to use.

## **Solar Panel Installers: Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Going solar is a smart and eco-friendly choice for homeowners, but if you’re not careful, mistakes during the installation process can lead to headaches and added expenses. Here are some common mistakes to avoid when hiring solar panel installers.

### **Choosing Unlicensed or Inexperienced Installer**

When it comes to [solar panel installation](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/solar-powered-air-conditioner/), specialized knowledge, and skills are required. Therefore, choosing an installer who is licensed and experienced in solar panel installation is crucial.

Unfortunately, some homeowners make the mistake of choosing an installer who is not licensed or experienced in solar panel installation.

The risks of choosing an unlicensed or inexperienced installer are significant. Firstly, you risk the installation being unsafe and not meeting all building codes and regulations.

This can result in serious safety issues, including electrical problems or fires. Furthermore, if the installation is not done correctly, it can damage your property and solar panels.

### **Not Considering the Installer’s Warranty and Maintenance Services**

Solar panels require regular maintenance to operate at their best, and the installer you choose should offer reputable maintenance services. Regular maintenance can help prevent problems with your solar panels and extend their lifespan. 

Choosing an installer who offers a warranty on the installation work is essential. A warranty on the installation work gives you peace of mind, knowing that if something goes wrong, the installer will fix it at no additional cost. A reputable installer should offer a warranty of at least ten years.

When choosing an installer, ask about their maintenance services and warranty. Ensure that the installer you choose offers reputable maintenance services and a warranty on their installation work.

### **Choosing an Installer Based on Price Alone**

When it comes to solar panel installation, it’s essential to balance price and quality. While choosing the installer with the lowest price is tempting, this can be a costly mistake in the long run.

Choosing an installer based on price alone can result in subpar installation work or low-quality materials, leading to problems down the road. For example, low-quality panels can lower efficiency, so you won’t save as much on energy bills.

When choosing an installer, consider the quality of their work, the materials they use, and their reputation in the industry. Don’t make the mistake of choosing an installer based on price alone.

### **Not Considering the Type of Solar Panels Used**

Solar panels come in different types, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Some homeowners make the mistake of not considering the type of solar panels used, which can result in a subpar installation. The three main types of solar panels are monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film. 

Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient but t also the most expensive. Polycrystalline panels are slightly less efficient but are more affordable.

Thin film panels are the least expensive but also the least efficient. If a homeowner chooses the wrong type of solar panel for their installation, they may not be able to generate as much electricity as they had hoped. 

For example, if they opt for thin film panels, they may not be able to generate enough electricity to meet their energy needs. On the other hand, if they choose monocrystalline panels, they may spend more money than necessary.

### **Failing to Get Multiple Quotes**

When hiring a solar panel installer, obtaining multiple quotes from different providers is important. This will allow you to compare prices and services and make an informed decision about which installer is the best fit for your needs and budget. Failing to get multiple quotes could mean missing out on better pricing or a more comprehensive service package.

### **Overlooking the Importance of Customer Service**

A good solar panel installer should have excellent customer service and communication skills. They should be able to answer all your questions and concerns clearly and professionally and keep you informed throughout the installation process. Overlooking these qualities could lead to misunderstandings, delays, and frustration.

### **Ignoring Online Reviews and Testimonials** 

Online reviews and testimonials from past customers can be valuable sources of information when choosing a solar panel installer. Ignoring these reviews could mean missing out on important feedback about the installer’s quality of service, pricing, and reliability.

### **Not Considering the Installer’s Approach to Energy Efficiency**

A good solar panel installer should strongly focus on energy efficiency and conservation. They should be able to advise you on ways to maximize your energy savings and reduce your environmental impact. Not considering these factors could mean missing out on potential energy savings and other benefits.

### **Choosing an Installer Based Solely on Location** 

While choosing an installer that is local to your area is important, it’s also important to consider their reputation and track record. Choosing an installer based solely on location could mean sacrificing quality and reliability for convenience.

## **How to Spot The Right Solar Installation Company**

Solar panel installation is a serious task, so choosing the right company is important. Solar installation can be done by highly efficient solar panels and solar photovoltaic installers specializing in [installing solar energy systems](https://www.idesignac.com/blog/how-does-solar-energy-work/).

A solar panel installation company can assess your energy needs and recommend a solar energy system that is right for you. They will also handle the installation process, which typically involves mounting the solar panels, installing the wiring and inverters, and connecting the system to the grid. If you want to find the right solar panel company, here are some [tips](https://www.idesignac.com/blog/steps-to-take-when-choosing-a-solar-panel-installer/):

1.  **Experience:** Look for a solar panel company with a proven track record of experience. The company should have years of experience installing solar panel systems and should be able to provide references from satisfied customers.
2.  **Licenses and certifications:** Choose a solar panel company that is licensed and certified. This ensures that the company has met certain standards and follows best practices when installing solar panel systems.
3.  **Quality of equipment:** Choose a solar panel company that uses high-quality equipment and components. The company should be able to provide information about the brands of panels, inverters, and other components they use and should use well-known, reputable brands.
4.  **Warranties:** Look for a solar panel company that provides comprehensive warranties for installation and equipment. This ensures that your investment is protected and that any issues will be addressed promptly.
5.  **Customized solutions:** Choose a solar panel company that provides customized solutions based on your energy needs and budget. The company should be able to assess your energy usage and recommend a solar panel system that is right for you.
