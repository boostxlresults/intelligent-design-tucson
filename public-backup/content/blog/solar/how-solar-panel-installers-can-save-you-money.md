## **How Solar Installation Works**

The first step in installing [solar panels](https://www.idesignac.com/solar/) is to evaluate your energy needs. This will help determine the size and number of panels you’ll need. Once that’s been determined, the next step is to install the mounts. These will hold the panels in place and allow them to move to track the sun.
