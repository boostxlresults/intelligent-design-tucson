# What to Do If Your Solar Company Closed in Tucson - Complete Recovery Guide

Over the last two years, dozens of solar companies across Arizona have shut their doors — including some of the largest names in the industry. Unfortunately, this has left many **Tucson** homeowners stranded with malfunctioning solar systems, unanswered warranty claims, and no clear path forward. 

If you've found yourself in this situation, you're not alone ([See the Solar Company Closure List](https://www.solarinsure.com/the-complete-list-of-solar-bankruptcies-and-business-closures)). This guide will walk you through the exact steps to protect your investment, restore your solar system's performance, and ensure you have ongoing, reliable support from a trusted **solar company in Tucson**.

## Why Solar Companies Are Closing

The solar industry has experienced significant consolidation and disruption. Many companies expanded too quickly, took on unsustainable debt, or struggled with supply chain issues and changing regulations. Whatever the reason, homeowners are left dealing with the aftermath.

At Intelligent Design Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Solar, & Electric, we've helped hundreds of homeowners recover from abandoned solar projects. As one of the only **triple-certified solar companies in Tucson**—certified for **SolarEdge**, **Enphase**, and **Tesla**—we have the experience, resources, and community trust to keep your system running at peak performance for years to come.

## The Top Steps to Take if Your Solar Installer Went Out of Business

When your original installer is no longer in business, it can feel overwhelming. Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to get you back on track:

### 1. Gather All Your Solar System Documentation

**The Problem:** Without proper documentation, it's harder to prove warranty coverage, system specifications, or past maintenance history. This can delay service or void certain protections.

**The Solution:** Locate and organize:
- Original sales contract and scope of work
- Manufacturer warranties for panels, inverters, and batteries
- Maintenance records and past service reports
- Any monitoring platform login credentials
- Installation permits and final inspection documents
- Interconnection agreements with your utility

### 2. Check Your Manufacturer Warranties

**The Problem:** Many homeowners assume that when their installer disappears, all warranties disappear too. This is rarely the case—most reputable solar equipment brands honor their own manufacturer warranties regardless of who installed the system.

**The Solution:** Contact your panel and inverter manufacturers directly to confirm:
- Warranty start and end dates
- What's covered (parts, labor, shipping)
- How to initiate a claim
- Authorized service providers in your area

**Common Manufacturer Warranties:**
- Solar Panels: 25-year performance warranty, 10-12 year product warranty
- Inverters: 10-25 years depending on brand and model
- Batteries: 10 years typical

### 3. Schedule a Full Solar System Inspection

**The Problem:** Without ongoing monitoring and maintenance, small issues can snowball into major failures, costing you thousands in lost production and repairs.

**The Solution:** Partner with a well-established, certified solar provider in Tucson. At Intelligent Design, we offer a **FREE solar inspection** for systems left orphaned by closed installers. Our technicians will:

- Run a complete performance analysis
- Inspect panels, inverters, and racking for damage
- Verify all electrical connections are safe and secure
- Clean panels and check for shading or debris buildup
- Test monitoring system functionality
- Provide a detailed report with recommendations

### 4. Get Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

**The Problem:** A solar system without monitoring is like driving without a dashboard—you won't know there's a problem until it's too late.

**The Solution:** Enroll in our **Solar Energy Monitoring & Maintenance Plan** for just $14.88/month. This includes:

- 24/7 system monitoring with real-time alerts
- Annual inspection and professional cleaning
- Immediate alerts for production drops or system errors
- Warranty claim assistance and coordination
- Priority service scheduling
- Performance reporting and optimization recommendations

## When to Call the Solar Experts in Tucson

Some solar issues—like cleaning panels—can be handled by homeowners. But when it comes to electrical components, inverter troubleshooting, warranty claims, or production loss, you need a certified, experienced solar company.

**Call a professional if you notice:**

- Sudden drops in production without explanation
- Monitoring platform offline for more than 48 hours
- Inverter error codes you can't clear
- Physical damage to panels, racking, or wiring
- Warranty claim denial you believe is incorrect
- Unusual sounds from inverters or electrical components
- Production significantly lower than estimates

At Intelligent Design, we handle everything from urgent solar repairs to long-term system optimization, ensuring Tucson homeowners have the support they deserve—especially when other companies have walked away.

## Proactive Steps: Protect Your Solar Investment

Even if your installer is still in business today, these preventative measures can save you headaches tomorrow:

1. **Keep copies of all paperwork:** Store them both physically and digitally in cloud storage
2. **Register your products:** Ensure all panels, inverters, and batteries are registered with the manufacturer
3. **Schedule annual maintenance:** A once-a-year inspection can catch small issues before they cost big money
4. **Monitor performance weekly:** Get familiar with your production levels so you can spot a problem early
5. **Know your warranties:** Understand what's covered and for how long
6. **Build a relationship with a local solar company:** Don't wait for problems to find reliable service

## Understanding Your Warranty Coverage

Different components of your solar system have different warranty coverage:

### Panel Warranties
- **Performance Warranty:** Guarantees panels will produce at least 80-90% of rated output after 25 years
- **Product Warranty:** Covers defects in materials and workmanship, typically 10-12 years

### Inverter Warranties
- **String Inverters:** Usually 10-12 years, often extendable to 20-25 years
- **Microinverters:** Typically 25 years
- **Coverage:** Usually includes parts and sometimes labor

### Installation Workmanship
- **Installer Warranty:** This is where closed companies cause problems
- **Alternative Coverage:** Some manufacturers offer extended warranties that include installation
- **Homeowners Insurance:** May cover some installation-related issues
