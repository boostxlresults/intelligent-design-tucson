### What to Do If Your Solar Company Closed in Tucson?

If you’ve found yourself in this situation, you’re not alone ([See the Solar Company Closure List](https://www.solarinsure.com/the-complete-list-of-solar-bankruptcies-and-business-closures)). This guide will walk you through the exact steps to protect your investment, restore your solar system’s performance, and ensure you have ongoing, reliable support from a trusted [**solar company in Tucson**](https://www.idesignac.com/).

### The Top Steps to Take if Your Solar Installer Went Out of Business

When your original installer is no longer in business, it can feel overwhelming. Here’s a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to get you back on track:

#### 1\. Gather All Your Solar System Documentation

**The Problem:** Without proper documentation, it’s harder to prove warranty coverage, system specifications, or past maintenance history. This can delay service or void certain protections.

*   **The Solution:** Locate and organize:
    *   Original sales contract and scope of work
    *   Manufacturer warranties for panels, inverters, and batteries
    *   Maintenance records and past service reports
    *   Any monitoring platform login credentials

#### 2\. Check Your Manufacturer Warranties

**The Problem:** Many homeowners assume that when their installer disappears, all warranties disappear too. This is rarely the case—most reputable solar equipment brands honor their own manufacturer warranties regardless of who installed the system.

*   **The Solution:** Contact your panel and inverter manufacturers directly to confirm:
    *   Warranty start and end dates
    *   What’s covered (parts, labor, shipping)
    *   How to initiate a claim

#### 3\. Schedule a Full Solar System Inspection

**The Problem:** Without ongoing maintenance and monitoring, small issues can snowball into major failures, costing you thousands in lost production and repairs.

*   **The Solution:** Partner with a well-established, certified solar provider in Tucson. At Intelligent Design, we offer a **FREE solar inspection** for systems left orphaned by closed installers. Our technicians will:
    *   Run a complete performance analysis
    *   Inspect panels, inverters, and racking for damage
    *   Verify all electrical connections
    *   Clean panels and check for shading or debris buildup

#### 4\. Get Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance

**The Problem:** A solar system without monitoring is like driving without a dashboard—you won’t know there’s a problem until it’s too late.

*   **The Solution:** Enroll in our [**Solar Energy Monitoring & Maintenance Plan**](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/solar-energy-monitoring-maintenance-plan/) for just $14.88/month. This includes:
    *   24/7 system monitoring
    *   Annual inspection and cleaning
    *   Immediate alerts for production drops
    *   Warranty claim assistance

### When to Call the Solar Experts in Tucson

Some solar issues—like cleaning panels—can be handled by homeowners. But when it comes to electrical components, inverter troubleshooting, warranty claims, or production loss, you need a certified, experienced solar company.

**Call a professional if you notice:**

*   Sudden drops in production without explanation
*   Monitoring platform offline for more than 48 hours
*   Inverter error codes you can’t clear
*   Physical damage to panels, racking, or wiring
*   Warranty claim denial you believe is incorrect

At Intelligent Design, we handle everything from urgent solar repairs to long-term system optimization, ensuring Tucson homeowners have the support they deserve—especially when other companies have walked away.

### Proactive Steps: Protect Your Solar Investment

Even if your installer is still in business today, these preventative measures can save you headaches tomorrow:

1.  **Keep copies of all paperwork:** Store them both physically and digitally.
2.  **Register your products:** Ensure all panels, inverters, and batteries are registered with the manufacturer.
3.  **Schedule annual maintenance:** A once-a-year inspection can catch small issues before they cost big money.
4.  **Monitor performance weekly:** Get familiar with your production levels so you can spot a problem early.
