If you’re a homeowner or business owner in Tucson, it’s important to know when to call a professional plumber. While homeowners can fix some minor plumbing issues, there are certain situations when it’s best to call in a professional plumber. Here are 10 signs that indicate you need to contact a Tucson Plumbing Company.

**1\. Your water bill is skyrocketing**

If you’ve noticed your water bill has been steadily increasing, it could be due to an undetected leak or malfunctioning plumbing system. A professional plumber in Tucson can investigate and repair these issues, potentially saving you money in the long run.

**2\. You have weak or low water pressure**

Several issues, including clogged pipes or damaged valves, can cause low water pressure. A plumber in Tucson will be able to diagnose and repair your plumbing system, restoring proper water pressure.

**3\. Your drains are frequently blocked**

If you’re dealing with clogged drains regularly, this could indicate an underlying issue. Drain cleaning is the answer to this plumbing issue. To solve this issue, you need to have the right tools. If you have tried to unclog the drains yourself and weren’t successful, it’s time to call a plumber in Tucson.

**4\. Your sewage is backing up**

If your house or business is dealing with sewage backing up into the premises, this needs to be taken care of immediately for health and safety reasons.

**5\. You’ve been dealing with plumbing problems for a while**

If you’ve been dealing with plumbing issues but haven’t seen much improvement, it may be time to call in a plumber. A plumber in Tucson can identify and fix the root cause of the problem. They have the right tools to get the job done right. So, if you are unsure where to start, call a reliable plumbing company to do it for you.

**6\. Your fixtures are corroded or damaged**

Corrosion and damage to fixtures can be signs of an underlying plumbing issue. A plumber in Tucson can assess the situation and make the appropriate repairs.

**7\. You have a leaky faucet or pipe**

If you’ve noticed water stains on your ceiling, walls, or floors, this could indicate a slow but steady water leak. You shouldn’t overlook this scenario as it may lead to further damage and costly repairs.

**8\. Water is pooling around your property**

If you’ve noticed excess water pooling around the foundation of your home or business, this could be a sign of an underlying plumbing issue. Find a reliable plumbing company and let them do the job for you, as they are more experienced in dealing with this kind of plumbing issue.

**9\. Your toilets aren’t flushing properly or overflowing frequently**

If you’ve noticed your toilets aren’t flushing properly or are overflowing, it could be due to a clogged pipe or a malfunctioning toilet. A plumber in Tucson can diagnose and fix the problem.

**10\. It’s been a while since you had your plumbing inspected by a professional**

Just like your car, your plumbing system needs regular maintenance to stay in good condition. Usually, plumbers recommend having your plumbing inspected every three to five years, depending on usage. So, if it’s been a while since your last inspection, contact a plumber in Tucson for an assessment.

## Tips to Maintain Your Newly Installed Plumbing

Let’s admit that a plumbing emergency can be a pain, especially if your budget is tight. That is why it is important to take steps to help maintain your newly installed plumbing. We also know that plumbing issues are inevitable, but with some basic precautions, you can ensure that your newly installed plumbing lasts for years to come.

**Here are some tips for maintaining your newly installed plumbing:**

### Make sure to clean out sink traps regularly.

First and foremost, it is important to regularly inspect your newly installed plumbings for possible leaks or broken components. If you detect any problems, contact an experienced Tucson plumber immediately.

### Avoid flushing items in the toilet.

People do not realize this, but flushing items that are not meant to be flushed can damage your plumbing systems. You must avoid flushing diapers, facial tissues, cotton swabs, and other items in the toilet, as they can clog the pipes and cause serious plumbing issues.

### Install water filters

Clear water doesn’t mean it’s safe from impurities; installing water filters can help filter out the contaminants from your water. Impurities such as chlorine, lead, and other chemicals present in water can damage your plumbing system over time, so don’t overlook this important step.

### Run hot water through your pipes periodically

If you don’t use your plumbing system regularly, make sure to run hot water in it every few weeks. Doing this will help keep the pipes inside clean and free from any buildup that could cause blockage.

### Regularly Check Water Pressure

If the water pressure is too low or too high, it could mean an issue with your plumbing system. There are ways to check the water pressure yourself, but it is always better to call a plumber in Tucson for an inspection if you are unsure.

### Have Your Plumbing Checked by Professionals

Although basic maintenance can help prevent problems from occurring, sometimes you need the professional services of a professional plumber to get the job done right. Regularly scheduling professional plumbing inspections and repairs ensure that any potential issues are caught before they become serious problems.
