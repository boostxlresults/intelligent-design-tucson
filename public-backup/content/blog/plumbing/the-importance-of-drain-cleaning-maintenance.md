Drain cleaning is essential for home maintenance. A clogged drain can lead to problems, from water damage to a nasty smell in your home. That’s why it’s important to schedule regular drain cleaning maintenance.

In this blog post, we’ll discuss the importance of drain cleaning and how you can keep your drains clear and functioning properly!

### Importance of Drain Cleaning

Drains that are free of obstructions keep your plumbing healthy and happy. When your toilet, tub, or sink drain becomes clogged, it can lead to problems. A slow drain is the first sign that there may be an obstruction in your drain. It can sometimes disrupt the pressure balance in your plumbing, resulting in significant problems like shattered or ruptured drain lines.

### Regular drain cleaning advantages

*   **Prevents costly repairs** – You may discover minor concerns before they become significant problems when you plan annual drain maintenance.
*   **Eliminates foul odors** – If you have a clog, it might produce an unpleasant smell in your home.
*   **Improves the drain’s lifespan** – By taking care of your drains and keeping them free of any buildup, you will increase its lifespan.
*   **Ensures proper drainage** – When your drain is working properly, it will ensure that water is draining from your sink, tub, or shower.

### What Are the Sources of Buildup?

Buildup is when there is a slow drain due to a blockage. The sources of buildup are many, but the most common include:

1.  **Hair** – Every time you take a shower, small strands of hair fall into the drain. Over time, these strands can form a clog.
2.  **Soap** – Soap can also contribute to drain buildup. When mixed with hair, it can create a sticky mess that’s difficult to remove.
3.  **Grease** – Grease is another common drain buildup culprit. It can come from cooking oil, butter, or even hand lotion.
4.  **Food** – Food particles can also cause drain buildup. When they mix with other items like hair and grease, they can create a clog.

### Trying to DIY?

You could use a plunger or a drain snake to unclog your drain. But if the problem is more significant, call for [professional drain cleaning in Tucson](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) to clear the blockage and thoroughly clean your drain!

### Why Shouldn’t You Clean Your Drains With Liquid Drain Cleaner?

When homeowners have a clogged drain, many go to the store and buy a liquid drain cleaner. Although this is a viable choice, it isn’t the best one available. Even though these drain cleaners are declared “safe,” they are not environmentally friendly.

The majority include extremely corrosive compounds that hurt local fauna while also posing a risk to the environment. Chemical cleaners can also harm pipes because they are corrosive if used frequently. Furthermore, unlike a professional, they don’t clear the drain.

If the solutions function to break the clog, there will almost always be buildup and waste left behind. Pouring hot water down a drain might help unclog small obstructions. When combined with boiling water, baking soda and vinegar can also be practical without harming the pipes or nature.

However, none of these choices will eliminate the drain blockage as effectively as a professional drain cleaning company.

### How Often Should Your Drains Be Cleaned?

Cleaning the drains in your residence is a vital element of house maintenance. The dimensions of your home, how often you operate your drains, and other variables all play a role in determining the number of times you must clean your drains.

Sometimes, tiny houses could escape with cleaning “as required,” while larger residences might require more frequent skilled drain cleaning. On average, annual upkeep is usually sufficient for smaller drain systems.

Larger drain systems and businesses, on the other hand, may require drain cleaning two to four times annually. It’s important to discuss your drain cleaning requirements with a professional drain company. They will help you develop the best drain cleaning maintenance plan for your home or business.

What can you do to keep your drains clear once they’ve been professionally cleaned?

It helps if you keep up with preventative maintenance once your drains have been professionally cleaned. You can do a few things to keep your drains clean on your own.

**Drain clog prevention**:

*   Purchase a drain strainer for each drain in your house to keep big objects from going down the drain and causing clogs.
*   Be careful about what you put down the garbage disposal.
*   Don’t flush over-the-counter toxic solutions down the drain, since they can damage the pipes.
*   Flush the toilet drains with boiling water to eliminate any buildup each week.
*   Whenever the garbage disposal is running, run cold water.

Implementing these preventive maintenance procedures and regularly hiring a drain cleaning service will help you avoid significant issues. Leaving your drains unattended may lead to stubborn clogs or an obstruction, resulting in pipe breakage, a reduction in water quality, and other problems.

### What to Expect From a Drain Cleaning Expert

Blocked drains are not just inconvenient; they may also be hazardous and cause considerable damage if left unattended. While using a plunger to unclog a drain is a helpful initial step, it’s time to contact a drain cleaning service if plunging doesn’t work.

Your [local drain cleaner](https://www.idesignac.com/) has the knowledge and skills to rapidly identify the source of any plumbing system obstruction and eliminate it without endangering the drain line or residence. Expert drain cleaning will also address your problem in the short term, and leave you with clearer, healthier drains that will operate better in general.
