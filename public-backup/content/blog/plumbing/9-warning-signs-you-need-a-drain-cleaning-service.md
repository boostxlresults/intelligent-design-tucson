Many people think about drain cleaning as something that is done once a year or so, but the truth is that you may need to have your drains cleaned more often. Drain cleaning is an essential part of maintaining your home’s plumbing system and preventing expensive damage later on.

Whether you’re dealing with a clogged drain or something more serious, it’s important to be aware of the warning signs that you need drain cleaning. In this post, we’ll go over the top warning signs that indicate you need to schedule a drain cleaning service.

### 1\. Slow Drain

A slow, sluggish sink drain is a very common plumbing problem. A slow drain is not only annoying, but it’s also a sign that your drains are starting to get clogged. If you ignore a slow drain, it will eventually become a complete blockage.

There are several tips to clean a slow drain:

*   **Pour hot water down the drain**: This method can help to break up any grease or soap scum that’s accumulated in your pipes.
*   **Use a plunger**: If hot water doesn’t do the trick, try using a plunger to unclog your drain. Cover the overflow hole with the plunger cup and push up and down, creating a vacuum seal.
*   **Use baking soda and vinegar**: Another common home remedy for unclogging drains is to pour a mixture of baking soda and vinegar into the drain. Let this sit for about 30 minutes before rinsing with hot water.

If you find that your drains are still slow or clogged after trying these tips, it’s time to call in a professional. At [Intelligent Design](https://www.idesignac.com/), our expert technicians can quickly and efficiently diagnose and repair any drain problems that may arise in your home.

### 2\. Gurgling Sounds

If you hear gurgling sounds coming from your drains, this could be an indication that there is a blockage in the pipes. Gurgling noises are caused when air is sucked into your pipes, which can happen if they’re blocked or clogged.

Gurgling sounds are caused by an air bubble that is trying to escape through the water. This happens when there is a blockage in your drain, and the air bubbles are created as water passes through the blockage. If you’re hearing gurgling sounds coming from your drains, it is a good sign that you need to have them cleaned.

### 3\. Water Backing Up

If water backs up into your sinks and bathtubs, it’s time to call in a drain cleaner! This is one of the most common signs that you need a [drain cleaning service](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/). There are many reasons your drains could be backing up. It may simply mean that there is a clog in your drain line, but it could be a sign of a much larger problem – like a tree root intrusion in your pipes.

### 4\. Slow Flushing Toilets

If you notice that your toilet isn’t flushing as quickly as usual, there may be a clog somewhere in the toilet’s drain line. You could try using a plunger or buying a closet auger to try and clear the clog yourself. But if the clog persists, it’s time to call in a professional.

### 5\. Foul Odors

If something smells gross coming from your drains, there is likely an issue with standing water in your pipes, which is causing the odor. This is usually caused by a clog, but it could also be a sign of a broken pipe. As with other warning signs, if your drains are emitting a foul odor, it’s time to call in a professional drain cleaner.

### 6\. Multiple Clogged Drains

A clogged drain isn’t just a nuisance. They can also be a sign that there is a larger problem with your plumbing system. If you are experiencing frequent clogs, this could mean that the pipes in your home or property need to be replaced entirely. The best way to prevent frequent clogs is by having regular drain cleanings.

While there are many possible culprits, some of the most common reasons for clogged drains include:

*   Hair
*   Soap scum
*   Grease and oil
*   Coffee grounds
*   Food particles
*   Feminine hygiene products
*   Paper towels
*   Cigarette butts
*   Tree roots

Tackling tough clogs can be a challenging and messy job. If you have multiple clogged drains, it’s time to contact a professional drain cleaning company.

### 7\. Water Pooling

Water damage is one of the most serious problems that a home or property owner can face. If you notice that water is pooling on or around your property, it could be an indication of a leak somewhere in your pipes. This is one of the most obvious warning signs that you need a drain cleaning. If you notice water pooling, you should call a plumber right away.

### 8\. Rust-Colored or Gray Water

Poor water quality is one of the many reasons you may need a drain cleaning. If you notice that your water is beginning to look rust-colored or gray, it’s time to call in a professional. This is usually caused by iron or other minerals in your water, but it could also be a sign of a more serious issue.

### 9\. Mold or Mildew Growth

Mold has a nasty smell and is extremely toxic to your health. If you see mold or mildew, it could be a sign of a leak in your pipes. This is usually caused by a clog, but it could also be a sign of a broken pipe. If you see mold or mildew, you should call a plumber right away to have them check your pipes.

### Keeping Your Drains Problem-Free

Drain cleaning is an important part of maintaining your plumbing system and should not be ignored. A professional drain cleaner will first use advanced tools such as high-pressure water jets and augers to clear clogs. By taking care of your drains, you can help prevent costly plumbing problems down the road.

If you are concerned about keeping your drains problem-free, consider scheduling regular drain cleanings from a professional drain cleaning company. With proper care, you can maintain your plumbing system for years to come.
