If you’re like most people, you probably don’t think about plumbing until there’s a problem. And when that problem arises, it’s usually an emergency! If you need to find a Tucson plumbing company, how do you choose the best one? There are certainly a lot to choose from!

At[Intelligent Design,](https://www.idesignac.com/)we understand that choosing the best plumber in Tucson can be daunting. That’s why we’ve put together this list of tips to help you make the best decision for your plumbing repair needs.

### Tips for Choosing the Right Plumbers in Tucson

These days, it seems impossible to find a full service plumbing company that is both reliable and affordable. But when it comes to finding Tucson plumbers, it is possible! Here are some tips to help you choose the right plumbing services company:

### 1\. Do Your Research

This is probably the most important tip on the list. When you’re looking for plumbing repairs, it’s important to do your research and make sure you’re choosing someone who is qualified and has a good reputation. There are a few ways to do this:

*   **Check online reviews:** Sites like Google, Yelp, and Angie’s List are a great way to see what other people have said about a company.
*   **Ask your friends and family:** If someone you know has had a good experience with a plumber, they’re likely to recommend them to you.
*   **Check for licensing and insurance:** All reputable plumbing companies will be licensed plumbers and have insurance. This protects you if something goes wrong while they’re working on your home.

The best way to find a reputable plumbing company is to ask around and do your research. Intelligent Design boasts the most 5-star reviews in Arizona, providing residential and commercial customers with honest, ethical, and professional service.

### 2\. Examine Their Level of Professionalism

When you’re talking to potential plumbers, pay attention to their level of professionalism. This includes everything from how they answer the phone to how they conduct themselves during the estimate. A professional company will always be polite and respectful, and they’ll take the time to answer any of your questions.

In addition, a professional plumbing company will provide you with a written estimate before they start any work. This estimate should be itemized and easy to understand. If a company is unable or unwilling to provide you with an estimate, that’s a red flag!

At Intelligent Design, we always answer the phone with a smile, and we’re happy to answer any questions you may have about our services. We understand that [plumbing issues](https://www.idesignac.com/what-are-the-most-common-plumbing-issues-in-homes/) can be sensitive, so we take the necessary steps to ensure your privacy and comfort.

### 3\. Inquire About Their Service Area

When you’re looking for a [plumber in Tucson,](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/) it’s essential to make sure they service the area you live in. Some companies only service certain areas, so it’s best to ask up front. This will save you a lot of time and hassle in the long run.

Once you’ve found a company that services your area, the next step is to schedule an appointment. Be sure to ask about their availability and make sure they can come out at a convenient time for you.

### 4\. Check Their Costs

This is another important factor to consider when choosing a plumbing company. You’ll want to get an estimate from each company you’re considering and compare their costs. It’s also a good idea to ask about any discounts they may offer.

Be sure to get all of the pricing information in writing before you make a decision. This will help you avoid any unpleasant surprises down the road.

### 5\. Keep Track of Their Timeliness

When you’re scheduling an appointment, pay attention to how long it takes the company to get back to you. This is a good indication of their level of customer service.

It’s also important to pay attention to how punctual they are. If a company is consistently late for appointments, it’s a good indication that they don’t value their customers’ time.

### 6\. Check How They Respond to Emergencies

If you have a plumbing emergency, it’s important to know that you can count on your chosen company to respond quickly. Plumbing emergencies can happen at any time, so it’s best to be prepared.

At Intelligent Design, we understand the importance of timely service. That’s why we offer 24 hour emergency service, seven days a week. We know that plumbing problems don’t always happen during normal business hours, so we’re here to help when you need us most.

### 7\. Choose a Full Service Company

When you’re looking for a plumbing company, it’s essential to choose one that offers a full range of services. This way, you can be sure they’ll be able to handle any of your plumbing service and repair situations.

Here are some of the services we offer at Intelligent Design:

*   Residential Plumbing
*   Commercial Plumbing Services

### 8\. Find a Local Plumber

A local plumbing contractor is more likely to provide you with better service than a national chain. This is because they’re familiar with the area and have a vested interest in their reputation.

When you choose a local company, you can be sure you’re getting the best possible service. In addition, you’ll be supporting your community and helping to create jobs for locals.
