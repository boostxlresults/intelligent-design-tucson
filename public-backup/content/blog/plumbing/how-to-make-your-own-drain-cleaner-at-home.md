## Benefits of Making Your Own Drain Cleaner at Home

Having a [clogged drain](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) can be a huge hassle, but it doesn’t have to be. By learning how to make your drain cleaner at home, you can save yourself time and money while avoiding the harsh chemicals found in store-bought cleaners. Here are some of the benefits of making your drain cleaner.

*   **Environmentally Friendly** – A [chemical drain cleaner](https://www.idesignac.com/is-it-safe-to-use-chemical-drain-cleaners/) releases pollutants into the environment, and can even damage your pipes over time. Making your own cleaner is a much more eco-friendly option because it doesn’t contain any harsh chemicals or toxins that could be harmful to both you and the environment.
*   **Cost Effective** – Store-bought drain cleaners are expensive, whereas making your own cleaner at home is much cheaper since you can use ingredients like vinegar and baking soda that you probably already have in your pantry. [Drain cleaning](https://www.idesignac.com/the-importance-of-drain-cleaning-maintenance/) solutions can range from $10 to $20, whereas homemade cleaners will only cost a few dollars.
*   **Safe** – Enzymatic drain cleaners are much safer than chemical cleaners because they use enzymes to break down organic matter in your drain. Enzymes are safe for both humans and the environment, so you don’t have to worry about any dangerous side effects.
*   **Customizable** – When making your drain cleaner, you have complete control over the ingredients that go into it. This means you can make a cleaner that is tailored to your specific needs and preferences. DIY drain cleaner recipes can be customized to remove different types of blockages, such as clogs caused by grease or hair. Partially clogged drains can also benefit from DIY drain cleaner recipes.
*   **Easy to Make** – Shower drains can be difficult to unclog, but making your cleaner can make the task much easier. All you need is a few simple ingredients and some elbow grease. With a bit of effort, you can get your drains running smoothly again in no time.

Making your own drain cleaner at home is not only cost-effective and eco-friendly but also safe and customizable. It’s an easy and effective way to keep your drains free of clogs and can save you time and money in the long run. So next time your drain needs some TLC, skip the store-bought cleaners and try a DIY solution instead!

### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Make Your Own Drain Cleaner at Home

Making your own drain cleaner at home is a great way to save money while also taking care of clogged drains. Some common household ingredients can be mixed to create a powerful and effective cleaning solution. Here’s how you do it:

**What you need:**

*   Baking soda
*   White vinegar
*   Boiling water
*   Cup
*   Bucket
*   Drain stopper

**Step #1 – Clear Any Standing Water**

If there is any standing water in your sink, you’ll want to get rid of it first. Use a cup or bucket to remove the excess water and then proceed with the next steps. It’s fine if there’s still a bit of water in the sink, but you’ll want to make sure that it’s not too deep.

**Step #2 – Pour in Boiling Water**

Once you’ve removed the standing water, pour in some boiling water. The heat of the water helps to break down any built-up grease or grime in the drain and can help loosen any blockages that may be present.

**Step #3 – Pour Half a Cup of Baking Soda Down the Drain**

Baking soda is a natural cleaning agent and its alkaline nature helps break down grease clogs, food particles, and other debris clogging your drains. Clogged sink drains are also caused by soap and hair, which baking soda can help break down.

**Step #4 – Pour Half a Cup of White Vinegar Down the Drain**

White vinegar is a powerful acid that can help dissolve grease, hair, and other gunk in your drains. The acidity helps to break down clogs and clear the way for smooth water flow. Drain opening tools can also be used for tougher clogs.

**Step #5 – Cover the Drain and Let It Sit For 30 Minutes**

Let the baking soda and white vinegar mixture sit in the sink or tub drain for at least half an hour before flushing with hot water. This gives the mixture time to work, breaking down debris and clearing out clogs. Baking soda and vinegar should not be used together in the same drain more than once a month.

**Step #6 – Flush With Boiling Water**

Once you’ve let the mixture sit for at least 30 minutes, flush out the sink or tub drain with boiling water. This will help dissolve and wash away the debris that was loosened by the baking soda and vinegar. Boiling water is also a natural disinfectant and will help kill any bacteria in the drain, thus preventing odors. For tough clogs, you may need to use a drain opener tool.

That’s it! Making your cleaner at home is easy and can save you some money in the long run. If this doesn’t work for your clogged drains, you might want to call a professional [plumber](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/).

### When to Contact a Professional Plumber

When it comes to plumbing problems, knowing when to call a professional plumber can be difficult. If you want to save yourself time and money, then knowing the signs of a more serious problem is key. Here are some common indicators that you should contact a professional plumber:

*   **Your drain won’t clear after using DIY methods** – If you have already tried to use DIY products or methods to clear your drain and it still isn’t functioning properly, then this could be a sign of a more serious issue.
*   **You are experiencing multiple clogged drains in your home** – Clogged drains can indicate an issue with the main sewer line that runs beneath your home. This is a job for a professional plumber.
*   **Your drains are emitting an unpleasant smell** – If your drain has an odd odor that won’t go away, it could be a sign of an underlying problem such as a clog or blockage deep within the pipe. A plumbing expert can identify and eliminate the source of the smell.
*   **You are noticing water damage or wet spots in your home** – If you have noticed any moisture, water damage, or wet spots around your drains, this could indicate a serious plumbing issue and you should contact a professional plumber right away.

It’s important to remember that DIY methods such as homemade drain cleaners can be helpful for minor clogs, but if the problem persists or is more serious it’s best to call a professional plumber.
