Assuming your drains are starting to back up, you may be wondering whether you should clean them yourself or hire a professional. While there are pros and cons to both DIY drain cleaning and hiring a professional ultimately depends on your specific situation.

In this blog post, we’ll explore when it makes sense to DIY and when it’s best to leave it to the experts. If your drains suddenly become clogged, here’s what you need to know before deciding on the best option.

## **What is Drain Cleaning?**

[**Drain cleaning**](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) is the process of unblocking and clearing drains from various blockages. This can include removing foreign objects, tree roots, sediment buildup, grease accumulation, and other debris that accumulates in pipes. Drain cleaning is often done using mechanical equipment to remove the blockage or chemical solutions to dissolve it. Hiring a professional plumber for drain cleaning is a great way to ensure the job is done correctly and safely.

Professional plumbers have specialized tools and knowledge to clean your drains properly, without causing any damage to your pipes or property. They can also diagnose problems quickly and accurately, saving you time and money in the long run. DIY drain cleaning can be dangerous, as it often involves the use of hazardous chemicals and improper methods that can lead to serious damage. Additionally, trying to fix the problem yourself could make the issue worse or even cause further blockages.

### **Reasons to Hire a Professional for Drain Cleaning**

When it comes to drain cleaning, many people think that they can do the job themselves. However, there are several reasons why hiring a professional is the best option for this job. Here are just some of the benefits of opting for professional drain cleaning services:

**1\. Professionalism**

Drain cleaning professionals have the knowledge, experience, and tools to take care of any clogs quickly and effectively. They know exactly which products to use for each problem, so you can count on them to get the job done right the first time. Drain cleaner from the store may be cheaper, but it won’t have the same effectiveness as professional products.

**2\. Professionals Have the Right Tools and Equipment** 

Clogged drains can be challenging to remove and require special tools to get the job done. A professional plumbing service has the right tools, such as a powered snake or an auger, to quickly and effectively unclog your drain. They also have professional-grade cleaners that can help clear away any residue left behind from blocked drains. Professional plumbers are trained in how to use these tools safely, ensuring the job is done quickly and properly.

**3\. Professionals Know What to Look For** 

Homeowners often don’t realize when they have a major plumbing issue. Professionals can identify problems including tree roots in the line, offset or collapsed pipes, broken seals around the pipe joints, and even poor installation of the drain piping. If you hire a professional they can quickly identify any issues with your plumbing system and discuss solutions before more extensive damage occurs.

**4\. Professionals Understand Regulations and Safety Requirements** 

Most local governments have regulations governing the use of certain types of drain-cleaning equipment, and professional plumbers know these regulations inside and out. Partially clogged drains can be cleared with certain types of equipment, while completely clogged drains require more powerful equipment and potentially additional permits.

**5\. Professionals Save Time and Money** 

By hiring a professional drain cleaning service, you can save yourself the time and money of trying to unclog your drains on your own. Professionals are knowledgeable and experienced in these types of issues so they can often take care of the problem quickly and effectively.

At the end of the day, it’s always best to hire a professional for drain cleaning services. Professionals have the knowledge and experience needed to accurately diagnose and fix your plumbing issue quickly and safely. Here at [**Intelligent Design**](https://www.idesignac.com/), we have experienced and certified professionals who can handle all of your drain cleaning needs! **[Contact us](https://www.idesignac.com/contact/)** today for more information.

### **The Risks of DIY Drain Cleaning**

DIY drain cleaning may seem like a good idea, but it can lead to more problems than solutions. Some of the risks associated with DIY drain cleaning include:

**1\. You May Cause Damage**

Sewer clogs can be tricky and if you don’t know what you are doing, you may end up causing more damage to your pipes or even the structure of your home. Here are some of the risks:

*   Using excessive force or incorrect tools can damage your pipes, leading to expensive repairs.
*   If you try to use chemical cleaners, they could corrode your pipes or harm any septic systems in place.
*   You may use inappropriate techniques that can lead to backups and flooding – not something you want in your home.

 **2. You May Use Products That Are Not Safe**

The use of chemical drain cleaners can be hazardous and can cause skin irritation, eye damage, or even respiratory problems. You can use safer alternatives such as boiling water, baking soda, vinegar, and salt. But using these products could also damage your pipes if you don’t know what you’re doing. Chemical drain cleaner may be a faster option, but it could lead to even more problems.

**3\. You May Waste Time and Money**

DIY drain cleaning can be time-consuming and may end up costing you more in the long run if you do not solve the problem correctly. Some **[sewer cleaning services](https://www.idesignac.com/plumber-tucson/sewer-line-repair-tucson/)** offer warranties and guarantees, which you will not get if you choose the DIY route. A clogged drain can cause a lot of inconveniences and an experienced professional will be able to get the job done quickly and effectively.

**4\. You May Do an Ineffective Job**

If you do not have the right tools or experience, your DIY job will likely be ineffective. This can lead to more problems down the line, such as backups and potential flooding. Clogged bathroom drains often require the use of a plumbing snake, which can be difficult for most homeowners to operate.

These are just some of the risks associated with DIY drain cleaning. To ensure problems are correctly and safely fixed, you should always consider hiring a professional plumber. They will be able to successfully diagnose and repair any issues with your plumbing system. Plus, they can also provide tips on how to avoid future issues.

#### **Hire a Professional When Your Drain is Clogged**

Overall, it comes down to your budget, timeline, and the size of the job. If you have DIY skills, you can use them for simple drain cleaning jobs like clogged sinks or toilets.

But if you are dealing with something more serious that requires specialized tools and knowledge, consider hiring a professional. Professionals come equipped with years of experience, specialized equipment, and the necessary knowledge to identify and fix problems correctly.
