Are you noticing a decrease in water pressure when you run your faucets, or seeing water backing up in your sink? It might be time to clean your drains! Drain cleaning is not the most glamorous of household chores, but it is still an important task in every household.

Slow flowing drains are not only annoying, but they can also be a sign of bigger problems. When water isn’t draining properly, it can cause backups and flooding. Not to mention, clogged drains are just gross. If you’re dealing with a clogged drain, don’t panic! In this post, we will outline the best methods for drain cleaning and preventing future clogs. You will learn drain cleaning hacks and feel like a pro in no time.

### Causes of Drain Problems

Dirty drain? Clogged drain? Slow drain? Whatever kind of drain problem you’re dealing with, there’s a solution. Drain line problems can be caused by a variety of things and usually, more than one thing at a time. Fortunately, drain problems are usually easy to fix. In most cases, you won’t need to call the plumbing experts. With a little [drain cleaning](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) using elbow grease (and maybe some drain cleaner), you can get your drains flowing again in no time. But before we get to the fixing, let’s take a look at other common causes of drain problems. That way, you can try to avoid them in the future!

Many different things can cause drain issues. Some of the most common causes include:

*   **Hair:** This is one of the most common drain cloggers, especially in showers and bathroom sinks. Over time, hair can build up and create a blockage.
*   **Soap:** Soap scum can also cause drain problems. When soap mixes with hair, it can create a clog.
*   **Grease:** Pouring grease down the drain is never a good idea! Over time, it can harden and cause problems.
*   **Food:** Kitchen sink drains can be clogged by food particles. Food scraps should always be disposed of in the trash, not down the drain. Otherwise, they can cause clogs. Garbage disposal units can also become clogged with food scraps.
*   **Foreign objects:** Toys, jewelry, and other small objects can easily slip down the drain. If they get caught, they can cause problems.

Aside from the above stubborn clogs, there is also a common drain problem which is called a “fatberg.” A fatberg is a build-up of grease, oil, soap scum, hair, and other materials that can accumulate in your drain over time. If you don’t clean your drain regularly, the fatberg will continue to grow until it eventually causes a clog.

In some cases, drain problems are caused by tree root intrusion. Tree roots can enter your drain through cracks or holes in the pipe and cause blockages. In some cases, tree roots can even break through the pipe entirely, causing a collapsed drain.

If you’re noticing drain problems, the first step is to identify the cause. Once you know what’s causing the problem, you can take steps to fix it. In some cases, drain problems can be fixed with a simple at-home remedy. However, in other cases, you may need to call a professional to examine your drain.

Now that you know some of the most common causes of drain problems, let’s move on to the solutions!

### How to Clean Your Drain the Simple Way

Drain cleaning is not the most pleasant task, but it’s important to do on a regular basis. The good news is that drain cleaning is usually pretty easy. You can do it yourself with some simple household supplies.

The first thing you can do is simply clean your drain. This can be done with hot water and dish soap. Just pour a pot of hot water down the drain and then add some dish soap. Let it sit for a few minutes and then flush with cold water. This method is usually effective for small clogs. Another method is to pour a cup of baking soda down your drain, followed by a cup of vinegar. The baking soda and vinegar will react with each other to break up the clog.

### Tools Used in Drain Cleaning

If the hot water method doesn’t do the trick, you can try using tools and chemical cleaners for effective drain cleaning. Here are also just some of the tools and methods you can use:

#### Drain Snake

One of the most common drain-cleaning tools is the drain snake. A drain snake is a long, flexible rod that you insert into your drain to clear away clogs. Supply stores sell drain snakes, or you can rent one from a hardware store.

To use a drain snake, simply insert the drain snake into your drain. Turn the handle to rotate the drain snake as it moves through your drain. The drain snake will grab onto any debris and help break up the clog. It will work its way through the clog, breaking it up so that water can flow freely again.

#### Plunger

If you don’t have a drain snake, you can try using a plunger. To use a plunger, simply place the plunger over the drain and start pumping up and down. The suction from the plunger will help to break up the clog so that water can flow through again.

#### Chemical Drain Cleaner

If your drain is still clogged after trying a drain snake and plunger, you may need to use a chemical drain cleaner. Chemical drain cleaners are caustic chemicals that break down organic matter, making it easier for water to flow through your drain. However, you should use caution when using chemical drain cleaners, as they can be harmful if used incorrectly. Always follow the instructions on the drain cleaner bottle and wear gloves and eye protection when using them.

#### Enzyme Drain Cleaner

Enzyme drain cleaner is a safer alternative to chemical drain cleaners. Enzyme drain cleaners use enzymes to break down organic matter, making it easier for water to flow through your drain.

No matter what method you use, drain cleaning can be a dirty job. Be sure to wear gloves and old clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty. If you have any questions, be sure to consult a professional before attempting to clean your drain yourself.

### Preventing Future Drain Issues

Now that you know how to clean your drain, let’s talk about preventing drain issues in the future. One of the best ways to prevent drain problems is to simply be careful of what you put down your drain. Avoid pouring grease, oil, and coffee grounds down your drain. These can all build up over time and cause a clog.

Also, be sure to run hot water down your drain after each use. This will help to flush any debris down the drain and prevent it from building up.

Regular drain cleaning is important to maintain a free-flowing drain. By following these simple tips, you can avoid drain problems in the future.
