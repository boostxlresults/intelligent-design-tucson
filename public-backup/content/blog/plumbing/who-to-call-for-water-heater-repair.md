Homeowners rely on water heaters for common everyday activities such as showering, cooking, washing dishes, clothes, and hands.

Therefore, water heaters are important to a household’s quality of life. It can be stressful, then, when homeowners find something is wrong with their water heater.

The [best professionals plumbers](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/) to call when it comes to hot water heater repair and plumbing concerns are those that have been trained for the job.

### **Causes of a Water Heater To Stop Working**

Various issues can hinder a water heater’s ability to perform its job. Whether the water heater is electric or gas determines the answer to the question. The most common request for hot water heater repair in an electric water heater is:

*   Blown fuse
*   Thermostat
*   Malfunctioning heating element
*   Hot and cold connections improperly crossed

When faults with an electric hot water heater are not immediately apparent, a system reset is a common answer to the issue. The following are some of the most common problems with gas hot water heaters:

*   Gas supply
*   Gas valve
*   Thermocouple
*   Pilot light
*   Running out of hot water —A tankless heater heats water on demand, so it rarely runs out of hot water, but in a busy household, a tank heater that is too small could be a problem.
*   No hot water —A lack of hot water is by far the most common complaint, and the cause can vary from a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker to a snuffed-out pilot light.

In the case of a gas water heater, the system can be reset in the same way. It is not as reliant on electricity as an electric water heater because it is a gas system.

### **Can a water heater be repaired?**

*   A water heater can almost always be repaired, depending on what is wrong when a plumber is contacted for water heater repair. As for the usual difficulties listed above, the general consensus is that a parts replacement, a system reset, or a water heater flush is required. Like any other system in your home, a gas or electric water heater comprises various components. One may be defective or be subjected to more severe use, causing it to burn out more quickly.
*   The thermostat and piping are the most common examples, with the thermostat sometimes required to sync up with the system properly or being installed incorrectly. Piping, on the other hand, is a little different. When a new water heater is inserted, the piping in the home is often not switched.
*   Flushing your water heater should be done once or twice a year. This is because sediment builds up in a water heater and, if left alone, can cause major problems for a household. However, a homeowner should do it more than once a year to once every few months, according to a professional’s recommendation. This is because it is very dependent on the mineral content of a person’s water.

### **Can you still use water if the water heater is leaking?**

*   To put it bluntly, if your hot water heater is leaking, you should never use it. Sediment buildup is the most common cause of water heater leaks. This is because the silt causes an imbalance in the regular pressure buildup, making the process much more difficult due to the ensuing problems caused by sediment buildup, the steel tank cracks, and rusts over time. When a person discovers a leak in their hot water heater, water heater repair is usually ineffective, and a replacement is required.
*   This is why, in order to avoid this problem, you must flush your hot water heater often. When you discover even a minor leak in your hot water heater, it can quickly escalate into a much more significant and more costly problem. A small leak will turn into a replacement if not dealt with immediately by a plumber.
