Do you own a home and never think to clean your residential drains? Many homeowners are unaware of the importance of keeping their residential drains clear, but it can make a significant difference in the health and longevity of your plumbing system.

In this blog post, we will discuss ten reasons why homeowners need to include scheduled residential drain cleaning into their regular house maintenance routine. Once you understand all these benefits and what can happen when drainage is neglected, you’ll see why proper drain cleaning is essential for ensuring everything runs smoothly around your home!

## When to Consider Drain Cleaning

Maybe some of you wonder if drain cleaning is necessary, especially if you haven’t had any severe problems with your drains over the years. The answer is: yes! It’s wise to get regular drain cleaning, even if there are no signs of blockage or slow drainage.

In general, it’s recommended to have a professional come out once a year for residential drain cleaning, although it could be more or less frequent depending on the size of your home and how much you use your drains. However, you can also contact a [professional plumber](https://www.idesignac.com/plumbers-tucson/) when you experience and notice these signs:

*   Slow drainage
*   Water backups
*   Foul odors
*   Standing water
*   Sewage backflow
*   Sewer clogs

## Why Homeowners Need Residential Drain Cleaning

If you haven’t had your drains cleaned in a while, here are 10 reasons why you need to include regular residential drain cleaning into your home maintenance routine:

### 1\. To prevent clogs and backups in the drain system.

Pipes can build up with grease, hair, soap residue, and other debris over time that may lead to clogged drains. Regular drain cleaning can help to ensure that the pipes are free of these materials and running smoothly. As time passes, these materials can accumulate and create major blockages that can cause slow drainage or even backups.

### 2\. To prevent damage to your plumbing system.

A clogged drain can back up with water and cause pressure to build up in the pipes. This excessive pressure can lead to serious leaks, bursts, or other structural damage. Getting regular residential drain cleaning can help to prevent plumbing damage by ensuring that your drains are free of debris and flowing properly.

### 3\. To reduce foul odors.

If you notice a terrible smell coming from your drain, it’s likely due to a clogged pipe. Residues such as food, hair, and soap can build up over time and cause unpleasant odors. If left untreated, these odors will continue to get worse.

This may also lead to mold and mildew growth, which can be even harder to get rid of. And worst, disease-causing bacteria can grow in these conditions, putting your family’s health at risk.

### 4\. To get rid of pests.

Pests like rats, cockroaches, and flies are attracted to dirty drains. If standing water or residue build-up in the pipes, it will attract pests and make them want to nest inside your pipes and drains. If left untreated, these pests can cause serious damage to your plumbing and spread diseases such as salmonella or E. coli.

### 5\. To save money in the long run.

Regular residential drain cleaning can help prevent major plumbing problems that can occur due to a clogged drain. This will help you save on costly repairs and replacement parts for your plumbing system down the road. Investing in regular maintenance now can save you a lot of time and money in the future.

### 6\. To maximize efficiency.

Drain cleaning can maximize the efficiency of your plumbing system by removing blockages and clogs that can restrict the flow of water and cause slow draining times. In addition, regular drain cleaning can help to prevent future clogs by removing built-up organic matter and other debris that can contribute to blockages. This can help to maintain the efficiency of the plumbing system over time.

### 7\. To increase water pressure.

If your pipes are clogged, the water flow through your home can significantly diminish. This can cause low water pressure in showers, sinks, and other fixtures. Regular drain cleaning will ensure water flows through the pipes with maximum pressure, so you don’t have to deal with slow draining or low water pressure.

### 8\. To prevent water damage.

If there is standing water in your pipes, it can cause serious water damage to your home. The constant flow of water causes the walls, floors, and other surfaces to become weak and porous. This can result in mold growth, paint peeling, and even structural damage.

By getting regular residential drain cleaning done, you can prevent water from accumulating and avoid costly water damage repairs.

### 9\. To keep up with local codes and regulations.

If you are a homeowner, you must abide by the local codes and regulations for residential plumbing systems. These codes include standards for drain maintenance and cleanliness. By getting regular residential drain cleaning done, you can avoid costly fines, penalties, and other repercussions for not following the codes.

### 10\. To extend the lifespan of the plumbing system.

Regular residential drain cleaning can help extend your plumbing system’s lifespan by keeping it free of debris, blockages, and other potential issues. By removing these elements, regular maintenance will reduce the stress on the pipes and minimize wear and tear. This will help to ensure that your [plumbing system](https://www.idesignac.com/drain-cleaning-tucson/) is functioning correctly for years to come.

### 11\. To improve air quality.

Clogs in your drain pipes can restrict airflow and cause unpleasant odors inside the home. When you get regular residential drain cleaning done, it will help to remove these blockages and improve the air quality within your home. This can make your living space more pleasant and comfortable for everyone.

### Tips to Prevent Drain Clogs
