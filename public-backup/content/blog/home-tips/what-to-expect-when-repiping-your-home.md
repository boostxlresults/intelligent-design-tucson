Many homes, especially those that are older, have piping that is made from galvanized steel. This type of piping is known for being durable and long-lasting. However, it can develop problems over time, such as rusting on the inside or becoming corroded. When this happens, it can lead to a number of problems, such as water pressure issues, leaks, and even flooding. Replacing the piping in your home is a big job, but it’s one that needs to be done from time to time in order to maintain a safe and functional home.

In this article, we’ll take a look at what’s involved with repiping a house. We’ll discuss the process, the benefits, and what you can expect when you have this work done in your home.

## **What is Repiping and Why is it Necessary?**

Repiping is the process of replacing the existing pipes in a home with new pipes. This is usually done when the existing pipes are old and/or deteriorating or when there are frequent problems with leaks or blockages. Repiping can be a big job, but it is often necessary in order to protect your home from water damage and to ensure that your plumbing system is functioning properly.

**Here are a few reasons why you might need to repipe your home:**

### **1\. Repeated Repairs**

If you find yourself constantly having to repair your pipes, it might be time to just replace them. Not only is this a waste of money, but it can also be extremely frustrating. Constantly dealing with plumbing problems can take a toll on your mental health and well-being, so if you find yourself in this situation, it might be time to consider repiping.

### **2\. House Remodeling**

If you’re planning on doing any major remodeling to your home, repiping is often necessary. This is because the existing pipes might not be able to accommodate the new layout of your home. Additionally, if you’re adding any new appliances that use water (such as a dishwasher), you’ll need to make sure that the plumbing can handle the increased water flow.

### **3\. Old Pipes**

One of the most common reasons for repiping is simply because the existing pipes are old. Even if your pipes don’t seem to be having any problems, they might need to be replaced if they’re more than a few decades old. Older pipes are more likely to develop leaks and other problems. If you’re not sure how old your pipes are, you can often find this information by looking at the blueprints of your home.

### **4\. Galvanized steel pipes**

A home plumbing system may have galvanized steel pipes. These pipes are zinc coated to prevent rusting, but over time the zinc wears away, and the steel begins to rust from the inside out. This can cause a number of problems, such as water pressure issues, leaks, and even flooding.

These reasons, among others, might necessitate a repipe job in your home. If you’re not sure whether or not you need to repipe, it’s always best to consult with a professional. Our team of experts at Intelligent Design will be more than happy to take a look at your home and let you know if repiping is necessary.

A leak free plumbing system is not only important for the structural integrity of your home, but it’s also essential for your family’s safety. Leaks can lead to mold and mildew growth, which can cause respiratory problems. Sewer or septic system leaks can contaminate your water supply and lead to serious illness. And of course, flooding can cause extensive damage to your home.

## **What Is Involved With Repiping A House?**

Now that we’ve answered the question, “what is repiping?” it’s time to take a closer look at the process. Repiping is a big job, but our team of experts at Intelligent Design will make sure that it’s done quickly and efficiently. Here’s a brief overview of what’s involved in repiping a house:

### **Inspection**

The first step is to inspect the existing pipes in your home. This will give us a better idea of what needs to be replaced and how we can best go about doing it. Without a thorough inspection, it’s impossible to know exactly what needs to be done.

### **Recommendations and Estimate**

After the inspection, we’ll sit down with you and go over our recommendations. We’ll also provide you with a detailed estimate of the cost of repiping. We want you to be fully informed before making any decisions.

### **The Repiping Process**

Once you’ve decided to move forward with repiping, our team will get to work. We’ll start by shutting off the water to your home and draining the existing pipes. Next, we’ll remove the old pipes and install the new ones. Once that’s done, we’ll test the new piping to make sure everything is working properly. Finally, we’ll turn the water back on and clean up any messes that were made during the process.

## **Benefits of Repiping a House**

While repiping a house is a big job, there are several benefits that come with it. Here are just a few of the benefits that you can expect:

*   Better water pressure – One of the most common problems with old plumbing is weak water pressure. This is usually due to corrosion in the pipes, which narrows the diameter of the pipe and limits the amount of water that can flow through. By replacing your old pipes with new ones, you can say goodbye to weak water pressure.
*   Fewer leaks – Another common problem with old plumbing is leaks. Leaks can occur in any part of the system, but they’re most likely to happen at joints and connections. This is because the seals and gaskets tend to degrade over time, which allows water to escape. By replacing your old pipes, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing that your home is leak-free.
*   Improved water quality – If you’ve noticed that your water doesn’t taste as good as it used to, it could be due to the quality of your pipes. Over time, pipes can become contaminated with rust, sediment, and other impurities. This can result in water that tastes bad and is not safe to drink. By installing new pipes, you can enjoy fresh, clean water that tastes great.

As you can see, there are many benefits that come with repiping a house. If you’re thinking about repiping, we encourage you to contact us today. We’ll be happy to answer any questions that you have and provide you with a free estimate. Don’t wait – call us today!
