Repiping your entire home is a great investment. It can make your home more comfortable, more energy-efficient, and safer to live in.

Repiping is the process of replacing old pipes with new pipes throughout your whole house. It’s a good idea because older pipes tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking or bursting. Repiping will also improve the flow of water through your home and make it easier for you to maintain your system without having to worry about leaks or other problems.

If you’re thinking about having a complete replacement of pipes in your home but aren’t sure how to go about it, this article will provide all the information you need on how to get started!

## **Repiping Your Plumbing System**

Repiping your home plumbing system, the circulatory system of your home, is an essential step in upgrading to a more efficient, modern, and leak free plumbing system.

While many homes still have their original plumbing systems, these systems were designed for a different type of home than what we live in today. Modern homes are much larger than older homes, which means that the existing pipes that carry water from the street to your home are often too small to handle the amount of water needed for daily use.

Additionally, as technology has advanced over time, so has our understanding of how best to protect our health and safety. Old pipes often contain lead or copper, which can cause corrosion and other problems when they are exposed to acidic water like vinegar or lemon juice.

Replacing these older pipes with new ones made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) will not only protect your family’s health but also help you save money on the water bill each month by reducing the amount of energy used by your heating/cooling system because there will be less heat loss through old pipes that have been damaged over time due to corrosion caused by acidic water flowing through them.

## **Repiping Your Home Sewer or Septic System**

A sewer or septic system is the most important part of your home, but many homeowners don’t think about how they work until they have a problem. When you have a clogged drain or a leaky pipe, you’ll want to get it fixed as soon as possible. However, when it comes to repiping your home, you should give us a call before any problems arise!

If your sewer system isn’t working properly, it can cause serious damage to your property and health. If there is an issue with your pipes that results in flooding or sewage backup into your home, then water damage will occur. This can lead to mold growth, leading to respiratory issues if not taken care of properly.

In addition to these problems, there are other issues that could also arise from improper use of a sewer system, like bacteria growth which can result in illness for anyone who uses this water for drinking purposes or even showering purposes (if it is not treated properly).

## **When Should You Call a Plumbing Company For a Repiping Project**

You should call a professional plumber for a repiping project in many situations. If you notice any of the plumbing issues below, it’s time to call any of the many plumbing companies in your area:

*   Your home smells like rotten eggs or sulfur (this is typically caused by hydrogen sulfide gas)
*   There is a frequent leak of reddish brown water coming out of your toilet trap.
*   The water pressure in one part of your home is significantly lower than in another part of your home.
*   You have frequent bouts with clogged sinks and drains, especially in the kitchen and bathroom areas.
*   You have experienced leaking pipes under the sink or on the floor near toilets or tubs/showers.
*   The toilet flapper (the rubber seal that keeps the tank water from running out) is not working properly.
*   Your water heater has been leaking hot water for a while, and you haven’t noticed.

## **Types of Piping**

There are several types of piping materials used in homes, and each has its own unique purpose. The type you use in your home depends on the needs of your plumbing system and the materials that are available to you.

### **Copper Pipes**

Copper pipes are the most common type of piping used in residential plumbing systems. They are durable, easy to install, and resist corrosion. Copper piping is often used for hot and cold water lines because they can withstand high temperatures without becoming brittle. They also work well in areas where there is a lot of pressure, such as under sinks.

### **Galvanized Steel Pipes**

Galvanized steel pipes are made from low-carbon steel that has been coated with zinc to prevent rust. They are durable, easy to install, and resist corrosion. Galvanized steel piping is often used in homes where there’s a lot of pressure because it can withstand high temperatures without becoming brittle.

### **PEX Pipes**

PEX piping is made from cross-linked polyethylene that is resistant to corrosion and heat. They are flexible and can be molded into many different shapes. PEX pipe is often used in homes because they’re very easy to install and maintain.

### **Lead Pipes**

Lead pipes are a type of plumbing pipe that was used in homes before they were banned by the U.S. government in 1986 due to the risk of lead poisoning and other health issues. Lead pipes are still in use today in some parts of the world, but they’re no longer allowed for installation in homes in America.

### **CPVC Pipes**

CPVC pipes are made from chlorinated polyvinyl chloride and have a high resistance to heat and chemicals. They’re often used in homes because they don’t corrode as easily as some other types of plumbing pipe. They’re also flexible and easy to install.

### **PVC Pipes**

PVC pipes can be rigid or flexible, depending on the type of plastic used to make them. Rigid PVC pipes are more resistant to freezing than flexible ones. PVC pipes are a popular choice for plumbing because they are inexpensive and inexpensive. They also tend to last longer than some other types of pipe.
