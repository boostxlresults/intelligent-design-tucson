“[Indoor air quality](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/improve-indoor-air-quality-tucson/)” refers to the air quality in a closed area, such as a house, school, office, or other building. The indoor air quality problem is a global issue. Exposure to indoor air pollutants, whether for a short or a long time, can cause several health issues, including respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer. 

In this blog, we will learn about the impact of Indoor Air Quality on your health, its causes and how to improve it.

## **Indoor Air Quality in America**

In America the potential impact of indoor air quality on human health is huge, below mentioned are some of the reasons why:

*   Americans, spend on average 90% of their time indoors. The concentrations of air pollutants are generally 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor concentrations.
*   Individuals like young children, older adults, and people suffering from cardiovascular or respiratory disease, tend to spend more time indoors. Exposing themselves more to indoor air pollution.  
*   Over the last few decades, the concentration of some indoor pollutants has increased due to increased use of synthetic building materials, furnishings, personal care products, pesticides and household cleaners.

## **What are the sources of indoor air pollution?**

Several factors are responsible for the poor indoor air quality. Indoor air is generally polluted by the pollutants that penetrate the outdoors and some sources that are unique to the indoor environment. The sources of pollution involve:

*         Human activities like smoking, burning fuels, cooking, and cleaning.
*         Vapors and pollutants released from materials used for construction and building.
*         Contaminants like mold, viruses, or allergens.

## **What do you need to know about the health effects of Poor Indoor Air Quality?**

Indoor air quality has a significant impact on overall health. Most people spend most of their time indoors. However, the indoor air might be polluted with invisible pollutants or contaminants, causing serious health conditions.

### **Health Risks Linked to Poor Indoor Air Quality**

1.  **Respiratory Diseases**Breathing in indoor air pollutants can trigger or worsen respiratory conditions. It could lead to:
    *   **Asthma attacks**: Pollutants like dust mites, mold, and pet dander can cause Asthma attacks.
    *   **Pneumonia**: Prolonged exposure to harmful pollutants increases the risk of lung infections like pneumonia.
    *   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: Continuous exposure to poor air quality can impact lung functioning, leading to long-term breathing problems.
2.  **Heart Disease**Pollutants like fine particulate matter in household air, have been linked to ischemic heart disease. These tiny particles enter the bloodstream and cause inflammation, increasing cardiovascular risk.
3.  **Cancer**Household air pollutants like formaldehyde or benzene may contain carcinogens, significantly increasing the risk of lung cancer.
4.  **Cognitive Deficits**

Studies have found that breathing in indoor pollutants like carbon monoxide and certain chemicals (called VOCs) can harm brain function. This may lead to trouble remembering things, focusing, or other thinking-related problems.

Some people are more sensitive to air quality, especially those with asthma, allergies, or chemical sensitivity. Even small amounts of pollutants can cause problems for these individuals. 

2.  **Age**

Age is an important factor. Young children and older adults are more at risk because their immune systems are either still developing or weaker. 

3.  **Existing Health Problems**

Easy actions, like letting in fresh air, using air purifiers and humidifiers and cutting down the usage of things that pollute the air, can greatly lower health risks and make you feel better overall.
