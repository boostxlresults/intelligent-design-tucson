It’s hot in Tucson during the summer. Really hot. If you’re like most homeowners, you’re probably running your air conditioning all day and night to stay cool. This can be a big strain on your energy bill. But did you know that there are ways to manage your air conditioning more efficiently and save money?

In this post, we will discuss 8 tips for managing your air conditioning in Tucson during the summer. Keep reading for helpful advice on how to keep your home cool and comfortable this season!

### 1\. Get a Programmable Thermostat

If you don’t have a programmable thermostat, get one! You can save money on your energy bill by programming your thermostat to only run the air conditioning system when you need it. For example, if you’re gone during the day, there’s no need to keep your home cool. Just set the thermostat to turn on a few hours before you get home so your house is comfortable when you walk in the door.

Programmable thermostats are easy to use and can make a big difference in your energy bill. If you’re not sure which model to choose, ask HVAC technicians for recommendations. A proper installation is important for optimal results, so be sure to hire a professional to install your new thermostat.

### 2\. Change Your Air Filter

Another easy way to save money on your energy bill is to change your air filter. A dirty air filter makes your air conditioner work harder, which uses more energy and costs you more money. Check your air filter every month and replace it as needed. If you have pets or someone in your home with allergies, you may need to change your filter more often.

An easy way to remember to change your air filter is to set a monthly reminder on your phone or calendar. That way, you’ll never forget to do it! An AC repair professional can also check your air filter during routine maintenance and let you know when it needs to be replaced.

### 3\. Keep Your Air Conditioner Maintained

It’s important to keep your AC system maintained so that it runs efficiently. An emergency AC repair can be costly, so it’s best to avoid it if possible. Schedule an annual maintenance checkup with a reputable HVAC company. They will clean your system, check for any repairs that need to be made, and make sure everything is running smoothly. This air conditioning service will help prolong the life of your system and save you money in the long run.

During your maintenance checkup, be sure to ask about indoor air quality. The quality of the air in your home can have a big impact on your health, so it’s important to make sure it’s clean. Your HVAC technician can recommend products and services to improve the air quality in your home.

Having your air conditioner regularly maintained by a professional is the best way to ensure that it runs efficiently. At [Intelligent Design](https://www.idesignac.com/), our team of HVAC experts can help you keep your air conditioner in top shape.

### 4\. Close Off Unused Rooms and Keep the Doors Closed

Do you have a room in your house that you never use? If so, close the door to that room and don’t run the air conditioner in there. The same goes for any other unused rooms in your house. By closing off these rooms, you can save money on your energy bill because you’re not cooling space that you’re not using.

In addition to closing off unused rooms, you should also keep doors closed throughout your house. This will help to keep the cool air in and the hot air out.

### 5\. Use Fans to Circulate the Air

Another way to keep your home cool is to use fans. Ceiling fans and floor fans circulate the air in your house and make it feel cooler. This can be a great way to save money on your energy bill because you can set the thermostat a few degrees higher and still feel comfortable. Ceiling fans are a great way to keep your home cool and save money on your energy bill. If you don’t have any fans in your house, now is the time to invest in some!

To get the most out of your fans, make sure they’re spinning counterclockwise. This will create a cooling breeze in your home. Also, be sure to clean your fans regularly so they’re operating at peak efficiency.

### 6\. Use Curtains or Blinds to Block the Sun

Sunlight can make your house feel hotter, so it’s important to block it out when possible. One way to do this is to use curtains or blinds to keep the sun from coming in. Another way is to plant trees or shrubs around your house. This will provide natural shade and help keep your home cool.

If you have windows that get a lot of sun, invest in some blackout curtains. Blackout curtains are a great way to keep your house cool and save money on your energy bill.

### 7\. Cook Outside When Possible

Cooking inside can make your house feel hotter, so try to cook outside when possible. This will keep the heat out of your house and save you money on your energy bill. If you don’t have a backyard, you can also cook on your balcony or porch.

If cooking outside isn’t an option, try to avoid using the oven. The oven produces a lot of heat, so it’s best to use it sparingly in the summer. Instead, try cooking on the stovetop or using a microwave.

### 8\. Keep Vents and Registers Clear

It’s important to keep your vents and registers clear so that air can flow freely. If they’re blocked by furniture or other objects, it can restrict airflow and make your air conditioner work harder than it needs to. Here are a few tips for keeping them clear:

Move furniture away from vents and registers: This will allow air to flow freely and help your air conditioner work more efficiently.

Vacuum vents and registers: This will remove any dust or debris that might be blocking airflow.  
Check for leaks: Duct cleaning professionals can check for leaks in your ductwork and repair them. Leaks can cause your air conditioner to work harder than it needs to and can also lead to higher energy bills.

Vents are an important part of your HVAC system in southern Arizona, so it’s important to keep them clear. By following these tips, you can ensure that your vents and registers are clear and help your air conditioner run more efficiently.
