If you are evaluating the cost of running fans vs. air conditioning, you are probably looking for ways of reducing your electricity bill. Everyone wants to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket. It is definitely a smart idea to assess your energy consumption and look for ways to cut back. To get personalized advice for making your home more energy-efficient, you might consider scheduling a whole [home energy audit tucson](https://www.idesignac.com/solar-tucson/home-energy-audit-consultant-tucson/). The HVAC technician will check for areas where energy is being wasted and recommend solutions that will work well for your home. The technician can also answer all of your questions about saving energy, such as the cost of running fans vs. air conditioning.

### The Cost of Running Fans vs. Air Conditioning: Air Temperature

There is no question that running a fan will use less energy than running a central air conditioner. However, an accurate analysis of the cost of running fans vs. air conditioning is a bit more complicated than that. First, consider this: Running a fan does not actually lower the air temperature in your home. All fans can do is increase the air circulation. When a fan is facing your direction, you will feel a little more comfortable because of the air flow being pushed at you. However, the air itself isn’t actually any cooler.

This means that in the height of a Southern Arizona summer, a fan isn’t going to do enough to make your home livable. You will still need to run the central air conditioner. In this region, fans may enhance a family’s comfort level, but they cannot serve as substitutes for an AC.

### The Cost of Running Fans vs. Air Conditioning: Energy Expenditure

While a single fan will not use a great deal of energy, you may be wasting a lot of energy if you use many fans throughout your home. And since you will also need to run the central AC, it may not make much sense to waste the energy on running fans. This is especially true since the newer air conditioning systems available today are highly energy efficient. Today, it’s possible to purchase a new central AC with a SEER rating of 20 to 26. A SEER rating of 20 or higher is extremely energy efficient./p>

### The Age of Your Central Air Conditioning Unit

Of course, the cost comparison is different if you have an older central air conditioning unit with a low energy efficiency rating. If that’s the case, you may be tempted to lower the temperature and turn on a few fans. Note, however, that you will still be struggling to keep your family comfortable because the fans will not lower the temperature of the house. Furthermore, these older units are prone to breaking down frequently and requiring expensive repairs.

If you have an older, inefficient AC unit, it may be time to think about replacing it. A new, energy-efficient model will keep your home nicely cooled down. You will be able to remove those bulky floor or table fans from your rooms and make better use of the space. A certified HVAC technician can help you choose a new air conditioning unit with the energy efficiency rating you desire.

### The Importance of Proper Installation

Many people assume that the energy efficiency rating of a new central AC unit is the most important thing to consider in terms of long-term savings. However, the most important factor is actually the company you choose to install it. You should only use a company with experienced, certified HVAC technicians—like Intelligent Design. A knowledgeable professional will take the time to accurately measure your home and discuss your family’s preferences with you.

This enables the technician to identify the correct size and capacity for the new AC unit. If a new AC is sized too small, it will have to work too hard to cool down your home. This compromises its energy efficiency. A similar problem happens when an AC unit is too large for the home. This will cause it to short cycle, which also negatively affects energy efficiency. When you choose a highly rated HVAC company with certified techs, you can avoid these problems and look forward to greater energy savings.
