It’s that time of year again, when we all start thinking about how to make our homes more energy efficient. One of the most common home improvements people decide to make is replacing their air conditioning unit.

Are you considering replacing your air conditioner? It’s a big decision with many factors to weigh, like price and efficiency. There are a lot of reasons to replace your air conditioner. Maybe your old one is on its last legs, and you want to avoid a breakdown in the middle of summer. Or maybe you’re looking to upgrade to a more energy-efficient model.

Whatever your reasons, this guide will walk you through the key considerations to help you make the best choice for your home.

Is AC replacement right for you? Let’s find out!

### Know When It’s Time to Let Go

Air conditioners don’t last forever. Even with proper maintenance, they will eventually reach the end of their life expectancy. With today’s heat, an effective air conditioning system is a must, and it is hard not to consider a new AC system.

There are several reasons why AC replacement may be the best option for you:

*   **Efficiency:** Older air conditioners are less efficient than newer models. This means that they use more energy to cool your home, which can end up costing you more in the long run.
*   **Reliability:** As air conditioners age, they become less reliable. This means that they are more likely to break down or require repairs.
*   **Technology:** Newer air conditioners come with updated technology that can provide you with better cooling, improved energy efficiency, and other benefits.
*   **Cost:** Although air conditioner replacement can be a significant upfront investment, it can save you money in the long run by reducing your energy costs and providing you with a more reliable unit.

If you’re thinking about setting up a new air conditioning system, contact a reputable [HVAC contractor](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-service-tucson) to learn more about your options. They can help you choose the right unit for your home and budget.

But hold on! Before you ring the experts, take a look at some of the considerations to take in before the replacement.

### Things to Consider for Getting a New System

Summer is in full swing and for many people, that means higher than average electricity bills. In Tucson, air conditioners account for about 15% of a household’s total energy use, making it one of the most significant energy users in the home. Air conditioning has indeed become a regular in peoples’ homes.

While replacing an old air conditioner with a new, more efficient model can save you some cost on your energy bill, it’s important to consider all of the factors before making a decision. But if you’re noticing a continuous or significant increase in your utility bills, it might be time to say goodbye to your air conditioning unit. Before you do, there are a few things you should consider.

**Here are four steps to take before replacing your HVAC system this summer:**

*   **Check the age of your current unit:** Air conditioners typically last around 10 years before they need to be replaced. If your unit is older than 10 years, it’s definitely time for a replacement. The older the unit, the more likely it is that its cooling system and air quality are already past its peak performance.
*   **Consider the size of your home:** The size of your home will also play a role in deciding whether or not you need to replace your air conditioner. If you have a smaller home, you might be able to get away with a smaller and less expensive unit.
*   **Determine the efficiency of your current unit:** Another thing to consider is the efficiency of your current air conditioner. If it’s not very efficient, it might be time for an upgrade. Newer models are much more energy-efficient.
*   **Check for rebates:** Before you replace your air conditioner, be sure to check for any rebates that might be available. There are often rebates offered for energy-efficient appliances, so you might be able to get cash back by upgrading to a more efficient model.

By following these four steps, you can be sure that you’re making the best decision for your home and your budget when it comes to replacing your air conditioning unit.

### Choosing the Right AC Replacement

There’s nothing quite like coming home to a cool, comfortable house on a hot summer day. But when your air conditioning breaks down, it can feel like you’re living in a sauna. If you’re in the market for an AC replacement, you should keep a few things in mind to make sure you get the best unit for your needs.

Choosing a suitable air conditioner replacement for your home can be a daunting task. There are so many factors to consider, from the size of the unit to the type of unit, that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few things to consider when choosing an AC replacement for your home.

#### Size

The first thing you’ll want to consider is the size of the unit. It’s essential to choose a unit that is the right size for your home, as a unit that is too small won’t be able to cool your home effectively, and a unit that is too large will use more energy than necessary.

#### Type

The next thing to consider is the type of unit. There are two main types of air conditioning units: central air conditioners and window air conditioners. Central air conditioners are more expensive, but they’re also more effective at cooling large spaces. Window air conditioners are less expensive and can be a good option for smaller homes.

#### Energy Efficiency

When choosing an AC unit, you’ll also want to consider energy efficiency. Units with high energy efficiency ratings will cost more upfront, but they’ll save you money in the long run by using less energy.

Choose the right air conditioner replacement for your home, and you’ll be able to keep cool all summer long. It is vital to choose a new air conditioner wisely and ensure that it has an efficient cooling system.

If you’re not sure which unit is right for you, an [HVAC specialist](https://www.idesignac.com/) can help. They can perform a heat load calculation to determine the size and type of air conditioning unit that will best meet your needs. Once you have the new unit installed, be sure to have it serviced regularly to keep it running efficiently.

### Preparing for the Replacement

Before you replace your AC unit, you should do a few things to prepare. First, consult with a professional to see what type of unit would be best for your home. There are many factors to consider, such as the size of your home, whether you have pets or children, and your budget. Once you’ve decided on the perfect unit for your home, follow these steps to ensure a smooth installation process.

*   Schedule an appointment with a professional.
*   Make sure you have the correct measurements for your new AC unit.
*   Prepare your home for the installation by clearing out any furniture or debris that may be in the way.
*   Follow the instructions of the professional installer to ensure your air conditioning replacement is installed correctly.
*   Sit back, relax, and enjoy the cool air!

### When in Doubt, Reach Out

Replacing your AC unit is a big job. It’s not something you can do on your own, and it’s not something you want to trust to just any HVAC contractor. You need to find a contractor you can trust to do the job right.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re looking for an AC replacement contractor:

*   Make sure the contractor is licensed and insured. This is important for your protection in case something goes wrong during the job.
*   Get multiple bids. This will help you ensure you’re getting a fair price for the job.
*   Ask for references. Talk to other homeowners who have used the contractor’s services to get an idea of what to expect.
*   Make sure the contractor is experienced in AC installation. This is a big job, and you want to make sure the contractor knows what they’re doing.

Taking the time to find a good replacement contractor will pay off in the long run. You’ll be glad you did when your new AC unit is up and running and keeping your home cool all summer long.
