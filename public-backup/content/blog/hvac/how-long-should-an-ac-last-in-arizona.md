If you’ve been wondering how long your air conditioner should last in Arizona, you’re not alone. Many people are curious about how to get the most out of their AC unit, especially in a state like ours where the summers can be brutally hot. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, there are a few things you can do to help extend the life of your AC and keep it running efficiently for as long as possible.

In this blog post, we’ll share some tips on how to care for your AC unit and make it last longer. If you’re looking for answers to the question, “How long should an AC last in Arizona?” read on.

## Factors That Impact the Lifespan of an AC Unit in Arizona

Air conditioning is a necessity in Arizona. But how long should an AC unit last in this hot climate? The answer depends on a few factors, including the quality of the system, the maintenance it receives, and how often it is used.

**1\. Climate**

HVAC system lifespan expectancy is typically reduced in dry and hot climates. Arizona’s desert climate falls into this category, making it more difficult for an AC unit to last as long as it would in other parts of the country.

[Air conditioning in Tucson](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/), AZ, homes is especially challenging due to the extreme heat. Cooling services in this area must be able to work hard against the relentless heat. Tucson heating and cooling companies must provide the best AC service possible to help homeowners get the most out of their systems.

**2\. Maintenance**

Air conditioners, like any other machine, need regular maintenance to function properly and last longer. To ensure your air conditioner is in optimal condition all year round, it’s best to have it serviced by a professional once a year.

During the [AC service](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-service-tucson/), they will check that the refrigerant level is correct, test electrical connections, and inspect the condensate drain. They will also clean the air conditioner’s coils, which help it to maintain its efficiency and keep running smoothly, and check that all moving parts are lubricated properly.

**3\. Usage**

Your new HVAC system will last the longest if you use it correctly. The way you use your AC can have a drastic effect on its lifespan and effectiveness. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using it, including regularly changing filters and cleaning coils as needed.

You should also avoid blocking any intakes or exhaust vents, as well as overloading the system with too many appliances. Lastly, make sure to turn off your AC when you’re not using it so that you don’t waste energy or overwork the system. Taking these steps will help ensure your HVAC system lasts as long as possible in Arizona’s hot climate.

**4\. Type of Refrigerant**

HVAC company professionals should always use the correct type of refrigerant when installing an air conditioner. It’s important to note that different refrigerants have different lifespans, and some are more efficient than others. For example, R-410A is a common refrigerant used in newer AC models and can last up to 15 years.

On the other hand, R-22 refrigerants are older and shorter-lived (about 10 years). Furthermore, some newer AC models use a combination of refrigerants to make them more energy efficient. It’s important to have qualified professionals make sure the right type of refrigerant is being used in your system.

**5\. Quality of Installation**

Most HVAC technicians agree that the quality of [AC installation](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-installation-tucson/) is just as important as the AC unit itself. If the installation is done incorrectly, it can be detrimental to your system’s longevity and energy efficiency, leading to premature failure or malfunctioning.

This makes it essential to hire a qualified and experienced HVAC technician to install your AC unit properly. Your air conditioning unit will last longer, perform better, and save you money in the long run. Plumbing service companies, such as [Intelligent Design](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/) in Arizona, can provide expert air conditioning installation services and ensure that your AC unit is installed correctly.

**6\. Power fluctuations**

Indoor air quality can also be affected by power fluctuations, as these can cause the system to work harder than necessary. When an air conditioner cycles on and off due to an overload or faulty wiring, it uses up more energy and causes wear-and-tear on components that shorten its lifespan. To avoid this issue, you should invest in a surge protector for your air conditioner to keep it running smoothly and efficiently.

**7\. Filters**

[AC repair](https://www.idesignac.com/ac-repair-tucson/) technicians in Arizona highly recommend changing your AC filters every two months to prevent dirt and debris from entering the system. This helps keep the AC running smoothly and increases its lifespan. Additionally, you can easily perform routine maintenance yourself.

Inspecting and replacing filters regularly will help your unit last longer while keeping your home cool. The heating system should also be given the same attention. Cleaning and replacing the filters in your furnace will help reduce strain on the system and extend its lifetime.

**8\. Environmental Conditions**

Cooling system components, such as air conditioners, will last longer in areas with milder seasonal temperatures. There are parts of Arizona that experience extreme heat during the summer months and this takes a toll on air conditioning systems. Hotter climates can lead to faster breakdowns of air conditioning components due to overheating.

In addition, desert dust may also become trapped in the AC filter and reduce airflow, making the unit work harder than necessary. Heating air conditioning systems in Arizona should be serviced regularly to ensure that they are running efficiently and last as long as possible.

**9\. Age**

Emergency plumbing and heating repair can be the result of age-related wear and tear. The average life span of an air conditioning unit in Arizona is 10 to 15 years, depending on how well it is maintained. As your AC gets older, parts are more prone to failure and energy efficiency decreases.

If you have an AC unit that’s over 10 years old, you should consider replacing it with a newer model. This will not only help extend the life of your AC unit but also save you money in energy costs. With proper maintenance and regular tune-ups, an AC system can last well over 15 years.

**10\. Quality of Components**

HVAC services professionals will tell you that the components used in an AC system are just as important as its maintenance. The type of compressor, fan motor, and other parts should be from a reputable brand; otherwise, it won’t last long.

Quality materials such as copper pipes and aluminum fins should be used for both installation and replacement. The heating service provider should be able to tell you which parts they use and their expected life. This will help you determine how long your AC should last in Arizona.

As you can see, several factors determine how long your AC unit should last in Arizona. With proper installation and regular maintenance, you can extend the life of your system and maximize its efficiency. Investing in a qualified HVAC technician to install your air conditioner properly will help prolong its lifespan and enable it to keep your home cool for years to come.

### Maintenance Tips to Make Your AC Last Longer in Arizona

Although the average lifespan of an air conditioning system in Arizona is 12-15 years, proper maintenance and upkeep can help extend its longevity. Here are a few tips to keep your AC running smoothly for as long as possible:

*   **Change the air filters regularly** – Dirty air filters reduce airflow, causing strain on the system and leading it to work harder than necessary. For optimal performance, check and change your filters at least once every three months.
*   **Clean the coils and fins** – The coils and fins on your AC unit can become clogged with dust and debris over time, which reduces its efficiency. To clean them, simply remove the unit’s access panel and use a garden hose to spray off any residue.
*   **Schedule annual maintenance** – An annual tune-up can help catch minor issues before they become major problems, extending the life of your AC and saving you money in the long run. Have a qualified technician inspect your system for potential risks and make necessary repairs or adjustments to keep it running smoothly.
*   **Insulate your home** – Insulation is key to keeping cool air in and hot air out. Make sure that all of your windows and doors are properly sealed, and consider investing in additional insulation for the attic or walls if needed. This will keep temperatures stable and make it easier for your AC system to maintain a comfortable environment in your home.

By following these tips, you can help keep your air conditioning system running efficiently in Arizona for as long as possible. However, if you do encounter any issues or notice a decrease in performance, it’s time to contact a professional for assistance.
