## **Central Air Conditioning System Maintenance**

### **Check the Air Filter Monthly**

As a business owner, you know that central air conditioning is a must-have, especially during the hot summer months. But did you know that one of the easiest and most important ways to keep your central air conditioning system in top shape is to check the air filter monthly and change it as needed?

A clean air filter helps your air conditioner run more efficiently, prevents costly repairs, and even prolongs your AC unit’s life.

If you need help with how to change or clean your air filter, a team of certified HVAC technicians can come to your business and thoroughly inspect your central air system. They will also let you know if it’s time for a new system and can even provide a quote for a new unit.

### **Annual HVAC Services**

A central air conditioning system is one of the most essential pieces of equipment in your home or business. It helps maintain a comfortable indoor environment year-round and can improve the quality of the air you breathe.

However, central air systems require regular maintenance to keep them running effectively. One of the best ways to ensure your system is running correctly is to have it checked by a professional annually. HVAC professionals can inspect your system and identify any potential problems. They can also provide quality service and make any necessary repairs.

Additionally, having a professional check your system regularly can help to prolong its lifespan. Scheduling an annual service call is important to keep your central air system in good working order.

### **Regularly Clean the HVAC System**

One of the most important things you can do to maintain your central air conditioning system is to keep it clean. Over time, your AC unit can become clogged with debris, which can reduce its efficiency and cause indoor air quality problems. Regularly cleaning your HVAC system from debris will help it run more efficiently and improve the air quality in your home or office.

There are a few different ways to clean your AC unit. You can hire a professional to do it, or you can do it yourself. If you decide to do it yourself, turn off the power to the unit before you begin. Once the power is off, you can either use a soft brush or a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush attachment to gently remove debris from the components of your AC unit.

Be careful not to damage any of the crucial parts of the unit as you clean. Then, once you’ve removed all the debris, you can turn the power back on and enjoy cool, clean air in your home or office!

### **Keep an Eye on Your Energy Bills**

One of the ways that you can keep your air conditioning unit in good shape is by keeping an eye on your energy bills. If you notice that your energy bills are suddenly higher than usual, it could be a sign that your air conditioner is having issues. In this case, you’ll want to contact a professional HVAC company to come and check things out.

They’ll be able to diagnose the problem and make any necessary repairs.

Mold and mildew can cause several health problems, so it’s essential to keep them under control. If you’re looking for ways to save money and improve your health, keep your air conditioner in good working order.
