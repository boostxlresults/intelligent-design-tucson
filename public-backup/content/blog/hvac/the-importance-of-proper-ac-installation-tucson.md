### AC Installation Tucson – Is Your AC Compressor Not Working? Here’s the Solution!

Is your AC compressor not working? As the heart of your air conditioning system, if the compressor isn’t working, your AC will be unable to pump chilled air throughout your home. And unfortunately, AC compressor repairs are notoriously expensive. However, there is a better, more financially prudent solution. Read on to find out how you can get free condenser unit replacements for the life with a new AC Installation Tucson!

### Possible Reasons for an AC Compressor Not Working

The AC compressor works by pumping refrigerant back and forth to cool the air. Some common reasons for an AC compressor not working include the following:

*   Improper refrigerant levels
*   Insufficient oil lubrication
*   Electrical problems
*   Blocked suction lines
*   Dirty condenser coils
*   Improper sizing on the suction line

As you can see, routine AC maintenance visits can help prevent these problems and extend the life of your compressor.

### Average Cost to Replace an AC Compressor

Most homeowners are shocked when they receive an estimate for the replacement of their broken AC compressor. The actual cost will vary, depending on your brand and model of air conditioner. The cost of the part may be between $800 and $2,800. On average, most homeowners pay at least $1,200 for the new part.

Then, you’ll need to figure in the cost of labor. When HVAC technicians encounter an AC compressor not working, they already know they’re in for a long repair job. It can take quite a while to properly remove and replace the AC compressor, which is why the labor costs may run as high as $1,200. In short, it may cost you about $4,000 or more just to replace the AC compressor.

### The Decision to Invest in a New Central Air System

Due to the high cost of a new AC compressor, many homeowners simply decide to replace the entire central air conditioning system. This can be a smart move if your system is getting old, as it will likely need additional repairs in the future. Furthermore, if you choose Intelligent Design to for your new AC Installation Tucson, we can recommend AC manufacturers that offer exceptional warranties.
