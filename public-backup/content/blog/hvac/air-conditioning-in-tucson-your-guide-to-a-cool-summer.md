It’s summertime, and the livin’ is hot! If you’re like most people in the Tucson area, you’re looking for ways to cool down. We’ve put together a guide to air conditioning in Tucson. Keep reading to learn more about the different types of air conditioners available, how to choose the right one for your home, and how to save money on your cooling costs this summer!

### Types of Air Conditioners in Tucson

There are several types of air conditioners available on the market today. If you are looking for an air conditioning system, you have a few different options to choose from:

*   **Central Air Conditioner:** This type of AC system uses a system of ducts to distribute cool air throughout your home. Central air conditioners are generally more expensive to install than other types of air conditioners, but they are also more efficient and can save you money on your energy bills in the long run.
*   **Window Air Conditioner:** This type of air conditioner is installed in a window or through an opening in the wall. Window air conditioners are less expensive than central air conditioners, but they are also less efficient.
*   **Portable Air Conditioner:** Portable air conditioners can be moved from room to room as needed. They are the least expensive option, but they are also the least efficient.

Once you have chosen the unit that is best for you, you will need the experts in air conditioning in Tucson – Intelligent Design! We have accurate knowledge and are true professionals in the business to help you make an informed decision.

### Choosing the Right Air Conditioner for Your Home

When choosing a new system for your home, it’s important to consider the following:

#### Size of Your Space and the Climate in Tucson

If you have a large home or live in a particularly hot area, you’ll need a more powerful air conditioner to keep your space cool. On the other hand, if you have a small home or live in a cooler area, you can get by with a less powerful air conditioner.

#### Energy Efficiency

All air conditioners use energy to operate, but some are more efficient than others. Look for an air conditioner with a high Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) to save money on your energy bills. Cost-effective air conditioners will help you save on your utility bills in the long run.

#### Cost

Air conditioners can range in price from $100 to $2000 or more. Be sure to shop around and compare prices before making your purchase. Also, look for financing options to make your air conditioner more affordable.

#### Noise Level

Air conditioners can range from relatively quiet to quite loud. If noise is a concern for you, be sure to choose an air conditioner with a low noise level.

#### Installation

Air conditioners must be installed properly to work correctly. If you’re not comfortable installing your air conditioner yourself, hire a professional to do it for you. Proper installation is important to the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner.

#### Maintenance

All air conditioners require some level of maintenance. Be sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully to learn how to properly care for your air conditioner. It is your responsibility to keep your air conditioner clean and in good working order.

### Saving Money on Your Air Conditioning Costs

There are several ways to save money on your air conditioning costs this summer:

#### Set Your Thermostat to a Higher Temperature When You’re Not Home

By setting your AC system’s thermostat to a higher temperature when you’re not home, you can save money on your cooling costs because your air conditioner won’t have to work as hard to cool your space. Heating and cooling your home uses a lot of energy, so even a small change can make a big difference.

#### Use a Ceiling Fan

Another way to save money on your air conditioning costs is to use a ceiling fan. Ceiling fans can help circulate air and make your space feel cooler without using as much energy as an air conditioner. Indoor air quality is important to your health, so be sure to keep your ceiling fan clean and in good working order.

#### Close Your Blinds or Curtains During the Day

If you close your blinds or curtains during the day, you can keep the sun from heating up your home, which will reduce the amount of work your air conditioner has to do.

#### Keep Your Air Conditioner Clean and Maintained

To avoid costly repairs and emergency air conditioner service calls, be sure to keep your air conditioner clean and well-maintained. Regularly changing your air filter and having your AC system serviced by HVAC technicians can help extend the life of your air conditioner and keep it running efficiently all summer long. Duct cleaning is also important to keep your air conditioner running properly.

#### Install a Programmable Thermostat

This will allow you to set different temperatures for different times of day, so you’re not cooling your home when nobody is there.

#### Sign Up for a Service Plan

A service plan can help you save money on air conditioning costs by providing discounts on repairs and maintenance. Also, make sure you search and check verified reviews before signing up for any service plans.
