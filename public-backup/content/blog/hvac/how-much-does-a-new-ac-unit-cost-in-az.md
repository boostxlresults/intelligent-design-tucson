Choosing to install a new air conditioning unit is a big decision. Not only do you have to think about the size of the unit and the features you want, but you also need to factor in the cost. In Arizona, the cost of a new AC unit can vary depending on the type of unit, its features, and the company you choose to install it.

The cost to replace or install your air conditioning in Tucson typically ranges from $7,000 to $25,000, depending on the type of unit needed to cool your space and its energy efficiency rating. This price includes both the unit and professional installation, ensuring you get maximum performance from day one.  
**Please note:** This estimate does not include any additional ductwork that may be required to accommodate your new system.

In this article, we’ll break down the different factors that affect the cost of a new air conditioning unit so that you can make an informed decision about what’s best for your home.

## **1: Type of AC Unit**

There are several types of air conditioning units to choose from, and each has its own set of features and benefits. There are three main types of air conditioners: central, ductless mini-split, and window air conditioners.

The most common type of air conditioner is the central air conditioning system. Central air conditioners are usually installed in homes with forced-air heating systems. They work by circulating cool air through a system of ducts and vents.

Ductless mini-split air conditioners are another popular option, especially in homes without existing ductwork. They consist of an outdoor compressor unit and one or more indoor air handling units.

Window air conditioners are the least expensive option, but they can be less effective than other types of air conditioners and can be difficult to install.

## **2: Size/Capacity**

The cost of a new HVAC system will also depend on the size or capacity of the unit. An air conditioner‘s size or capacity is typically measured in tons. The rule of thumb is that the larger the space you need to cool, the more tonnage or capacity you will need. For example, a one-ton unit can cool approximately 400 square feet, while a three-ton unit can cool 1200 square feet.

When shopping for a new air conditioner, it is important to have a cooling load calculation done by a professional. This will take into consideration things like the size of your home, the amount of insulation, the number and size of windows, and more. With this information, they can help you choose the right-sized unit for your home.

Getting the right size is important because:

*   If the unit is too small, it will have to work harder to cool your home and will not be able to keep up on hot days. This can lead to higher energy bills and shortened lifespan of the unit.
*   If the unit is too large, it will cool your home too quickly and then shut off before removing all the humidity. This can leave your home feeling damp and clammy.

An HVAC company can do a load calculation for you to ensure you get the best sized unit for your home.

**Pro tips:**

*   Get at least three quotes before having any HVAC services done
*   Be sure to ask each company what size unit they are recommending for your home.
*   Don’t be afraid to get a second opinion if you feel like the company is trying to upsell you on a unit that is too large or too expensive.

## **3: Features** 

The features your new system has will also affect its price. Some common features include: 

*   **SEER rating:** This is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio and it measures how much energy your unit uses compared to other units. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient your unit is, and the lower your energy bills will be. 
*   **Dehumidifier:** A dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air, which can help improve indoor air quality and make your home more comfortable during hot, humid weather. 
*   **Programmable thermostat:** A programmable thermostat allows you to set different temperatures for different times of the day so that you don’t have to cool your entire home when no one is home during the day. 
*   **Zoning:** Zoning divides your home into different “zones” so that you can control the temperature in each zone separately. This allows you to focus on cooling only the rooms that are being used, which saves energy. 

If you live in Southern Arizona, then you know how important it is to have a good air conditioner. AC repair is never fun, but it is necessary from time to time. By having a new, energy-efficient AC unit installed, you can rest assured that your home will be cool and comfortable all summer long.

## **4: SEER rating**

The Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) is a measure of how much energy your unit uses compared to other units. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient your unit is, and the lower your energy bills will be.

The minimum SEER rating for new air conditioners is 14, but units with a SEER rating of 20 or higher are available. If you live in an area with hot weather, it is worth paying more for a unit with a higher SEER rating to save on your energy bills.

Not sure what SEER rating you need? A professional HVAC contractor can help you choose the right unit for your home. A quality service company will also make sure your unit is installed properly to ensure it runs efficiently.

Be sure to check the Better Business Bureau for reviews before hiring an HVAC contractor. You don’t want to end up with costly repairs because of a shoddy installation job.

## **5: Installation Company**

Another factor that will affect the cost of your new AC unit is who you choose to install it. It’s important to choose a reputable company with experience installing AC units in Arizona. Proper installation is critical to the performance of your new AC unit. Be sure to get multiple quotes before making a decision so that you can compare costs and find the best deal.

A professional job will cost more than a do-it-yourself installation, but it’s worth it to make sure the job is done right. Hiring a professional also gives you the peace of mind that comes with knowing your new AC unit is under warranty.

If you’re not sure who to hire, ask around for recommendations from friends or family. An exceptional service company should have no problem providing you with references.

## **Conclusion**

The cost of a new AC unit in Arizona can vary greatly depending on a number of factors. If you are in need of a new AC unit, be sure to consult with a reputable HVAC contractor to get an accurate estimate of what it will cost to cool your home.

While the initial investment for a new AC unit may be higher than repairing an old one, you will save money in the long run on energy bills and repairs. A new AC unit is a wise investment that will keep your family cool and comfortable for years to come.
