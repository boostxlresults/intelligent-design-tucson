Summer is right around the corner, and that means one thing: it’s time to start thinking about air conditioning! If you’re living in Tucson, you know how hot it can get during the summer months. This year, don’t let the heat get to you – invest in a good air conditioning unit for your home. But with so many options on the market, how do you choose the right one? There are a variety of factors you need to consider when making your decision, including size, type, and brand.

In this article, we will discuss some factors to consider when choosing an air conditioner for your home.

### Basics of Central Air Conditioning System

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of choosing an AC unit, let’s first review the basics. A central air conditioning system consists of two parts: an indoor unit (evaporator coil and blower) and an outdoor unit (condenser coil and compressor). The evaporator coil is located inside your home, often in the attic or basement. The outdoor unit is usually located on the ground outside your home.

The evaporator coil absorbs heat from the air inside your home and passes it to the condenser coil. The condenser coil then releases the heat outdoors. Meanwhile, the compressor circulates refrigerant between the coils and helps to remove moisture from the air.

[Indoor air quality](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/improve-indoor-air-quality-tucson/) is important, especially if you or someone in your family suffers from allergies or asthma. An HVAC system can help to improve indoor air quality by circulating clean, filtered air throughout your home.

Now that you know the basics of a central air conditioning system let’s move on to choosing the right unit for your home.

### Determine What Size Air Conditioner You Require

The first step in choosing an AC unit is to determine the size of the unit you need. The size of your unit will be determined by a number of factors; here are a few to keep in mind:

*   Square footage of your home
*   Age of your home
*   Number of rooms in your home
*   Climate you live in
*   Your insulation
*   Number of people who live in your home

You can use an AC sizing calculator to help you determine the right size unit for your home. An [HVAC services](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/) company will also be able to help you determine the right size unit for your home. Even two homes with identical square footage can have different cooling needs, so it’s important to consult with an expert before making your purchase.

### Considering the Climate in Tucson AZ

Southern Arizona is a desert climate, which means it is hot and dry most of the year. The average high temperature in Tucson is 85 degrees, with lows dipping down to 65 degrees at night. However, it’s not uncommon for temperatures to reach 100 degrees or higher during the summer months.

If you live in Tucson, you know that the heat can be unbearable at times. That’s why it’s important to choose a new HVAC system that can handle extreme heat. Consider investing in a unit with a higher SEER rating; this will ensure that your unit can handle the hot temperatures.

[AC repair](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/) and replacement companies often offer a free in-home estimate to help you determine the best AC unit for your home. This is a great way to get expert advice and ensure that you’re making the best decision for your needs.

### Choose the Type of Central Air Conditioner You Want

Now that you know the size and climate considerations for your new AC unit, it’s time to start thinking about the type of unit you want. There are four types of central air conditioners to choose from:

#### 1\. Packaged Central Air Conditioners

A packaged central air conditioner is a single unit that contains all the components of a central AC system. These units are usually located on the ground outside your home.

Packaged central air conditioners are a good choice for homes with limited space inside, such as apartments or condos. They are also a good choice if you live in an area with extreme temperatures, as they are designed to handle extreme heat and cold.

#### 2\. Split-System Central Air Conditioners

A split-system central air conditioner consists of two units: an outdoor unit and an indoor unit. The outdoor unit contains the compressor and condenser, while the indoor unit contains the evaporator.

Split-system central air conditioners are a good choice for most homes. They are less expensive than packaged units and offer more flexibility when it comes to installation. Proper installation is important, however, as improper installation can lead to leaks and other problems.

#### 3\. Mini-Split/Ductless Air Conditioners

A mini-split or ductless air conditioner is a type of split-system AC unit. However, unlike a traditional split-system AC, a mini-split or ductless AC unit does not require ductwork.

Mini-splits are a good choice for homes that do not have existing ductwork. They are also a good choice for homes with unique cooling needs, such as a room that is hotter or cooler than the rest of the house. A new system can be installed in as little as a day, making it a convenient option for many homeowners.

#### 4\. Geothermal Heat Pumps

A geothermal heat pump is a type of central air conditioner that uses the earth’s natural heat to cool your home. These units are extremely efficient and can save you money on your energy bill.

Geothermal heat pumps are a good choice for homeowners who want to reduce their carbon footprint. They are also a good choice for homeowners who want to save money on their energy bill. However, geothermal heat pumps are more expensive than other types of AC units.

### Choose an Energy Efficiency Rating

The energy efficiency of your new air conditioner is important for two reasons: it will save you money on your energy bill, and it will help reduce your carbon footprint. When choosing a new AC unit, look for one with a high SEER rating. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficient the unit will be. In general, it is best to choose a unit with a SEER rating of at least 16.

Energy-efficient equipment tends to cost more upfront. However, over time, you will save money on your energy bill. In addition, energy-efficient equipment often comes with rebates and tax incentives.

A quality service company like Intelligent Design can help you choose an air conditioner with the right SEER rating for your home. We can also help you take advantage of any rebates or tax incentives that may be available.

### What Happens if I Buy and Install the Wrong AC Unit Size?

If you buy and install an AC unit that is too small or too large, it will not work properly. An AC unit that is too small will not be able to cool your home properly. As a result, your home will be uncomfortable, and you will likely see an increase in your energy bill. An AC unit that is too large will cool your home too quickly. As a result, your home will not be properly dehumidified, and you will likely see an increase in your energy bill.

When choosing a new AC unit, it is important to consult with a qualified HVAC technician. A qualified technician can help you choose the right size unit for your home. They can also help you calculate the proper size unit for your home.
