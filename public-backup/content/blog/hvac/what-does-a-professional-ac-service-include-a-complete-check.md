When Arizona’s heat ramps up, an air-conditioner is a must-have. And that is why taking care of your cooling system so that it runs well is important for your comfort level and energy efficiency. But what does a professional air conditioning service even entail, and why should you never skip one? 

_This article will take you beyond the standard list of what is performed when your air conditioning unit receives a professional service. Intelligent Design Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Solar, & Electric provides the_ best **_[air conditioner service in Tucson](https://www.idesignac.com/)_** _that overall helps homeowners steer clear of unpleasant outages._

## Why Professional AC Service is Important

Many homeowners think that just cleaning or replacing the filters will keep their AC performing well. While this is part of it, a full service will go much deeper than that. Here is why regular professional service for [**AC in Tucson**](https://www.idesignac.com/) is important:

*   **Energy Efficiency**: A service AC will use less power, so it will lower energy costs.

*   **Extended Lifespan:** When AC services are run regularly, it prevents premature wear and tear to the system.

*   **Safety:** Regulations dictate that companies sanitize their own coils and filters, and keeping them clean only helps the health of your family.

*   **Fewer Breakdowns**: When you get a service, you will often notice the small problems before they become very expensive and need repairs.

## The Complete Professional AC Service Checklist

### 1\. Air Filter cleaning or replacement

We clean or replace filters, restoring airflow and air quality. This step is vital in desert climates because dust builds up quickly. 

### 2\. Thermostat Calibration & System Controls

Our [**air conditioning in Tucson**](https://www.idesignac.com/) tests and recalibrates thermostats for accuracy. This confirms that your system cycles as intended, preventing wasted energy.

### 3\. Electrical Connections Inspection

Loose or frayed wires pose a safety hazard. All documents on your AC service call detail inspectors safely: tighten connections according to manufacturer specifications, voltage test, and operate switch gears, among all electrical components.

### 4\. Refrigerant Level Check & Leak Testing

We look for leaks, recharge levels, and refrigerant R-value, ensuring your system achieves maximum cooling capacity.

### 5\. Cleaning Condenser & Evaporator Coils

Dust and dirt on coils negatively impact efficiency. Our technicians of **[AC installation in Tucson](https://www.idesignac.com/), AZ** clean the coils to allow for maximum heat exchange, thus cooling your home.

### 6\. Check and Clear Drain Lines

Blocked drain lines can cause water leaks, mold growth, and system failure. Our techs will clear and flush your drain lines to keep everything dry and mold-free.

### 7\. Provide Lubrication for Moving Parts

Moving parts like motors, fans, and bearings need lubrication in order to reduce friction. With proper lubrication, the chance of overheating as well as the lifetime of the system is improved.

### 8\. Blower and Airflow Testing

Proper airflow is essential for even cooling. We will inspect the blower operation and check the air flow to prevent any blockages that can impact cooling.

### 9\. Overall System Performance Test

We will test your system overall, including cooling output, efficiency, cycling, and noise, to make sure everything is in proper operating order.

## How Often Do I Need Air Conditioning Service? 

We suggest you service your air conditioning at least biannually, once in the spring, before using it heavily in the summer, and again in the fall. If your pets, allergies, or heavier use cause you to run your air conditioning unit more frequently, it makes sense to schedule an [**HVAC service**](https://www.idesignac.com/tucson-hvac-contractors/) more than twice a year.

Sometimes, regardless of your regular maintenance, it is just time for your air conditioning to get extra care. If you notice any signs listed below, please call for [**air conditioner repair in Tucson**](https://www.idesignac.com/). 

*   Poor or uneven cooling. 
*   Unusual sounds (such as rattling, grinding, etc.)

*   Frequent short cycling or water leaks.
