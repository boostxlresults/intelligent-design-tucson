There are many factors that contribute to good health, including nutrition, physical activity, and yes, even air conditioning. The health benefits of air conditioning are varied, but the most obvious one is preventing heat-related deaths. In [Southern Arizona](https://www.idesignac.com/service-areas/), it commonly reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit and above during the summer. Sometimes, the temperature can climb as high as 115 or even hotter. Inside a parked car or a home without AC, the temperature can get high enough to induce life-threatening hyperthermia. In this region, central air conditioning is definitely a must-have, not a luxury.

### Health Benefits of Air Conditioning: The Dangers of Heat-Related Illnesses

Heat-related illnesses occur in three stages. The first, heat cramps, is the mildest. Heat cramps refer to involuntary, painful muscle spasms. Heat cramps can usually be treated without a visit to the ER. Individuals are advised to get to a cool place, drink an electrolyte-rich beverage, and avoid physical exertion for at least a few hours.

The next stage, heat exhaustion, is more serious. It can be brought on by exposure to high temperatures, especially when the humidity is also high. It’s indicated by heavy sweating, feeling faint, dizziness, muscle cramps, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Drinking cool fluids, taking a cool shower, and resting can often treat heat exhaustion, but medical attention may be necessary.

If heat exhaustion isn’t treated immediately, then [heatstroke](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/heat-stroke-symptoms-and-treatment) can occur. This is the most serious heat-related illness, and it can be deadly. It occurs when the core body temperature reaches 104 degrees or higher. In addition to a racing heartbeat and rapid breathing, heatstroke can alter one’s mental state. Please seek immediate medical attention if you or someone else could be experiencing heatstroke.

Note that the elderly and young children are especially susceptible to heat-related illnesses. For these individuals, it’s essential to stay in an air conditioned building during heat waves.

### Health Benefits of Air Conditioning: Advantages Over Swamp Coolers

Another way to evaluate the health benefits of air conditioning is to compare a central AC system to a swamp cooler. Swamp coolers use evaporative technology to cool the air. Unfortunately, this also means that the home will have a higher humidity level. If the dry air brought you to Arizona, then this can be an issue.

Another problem associated with the increased humidity levels is the potential for mold growth. It won’t take long for mold to proliferate in a damp environment. Chronic mold exposure can lead to physical health problems, including respiratory difficulties, headaches, nasal stuffiness, throat irritation, and eye irritation. People with asthma or allergies are at a particularly high risk of mold-induced health problems.

For homes that currently have a swamp cooler, the health benefits of air conditioning are clear. A central AC will purify the air and maintain a comfortable humidity level, while simultaneously discouraging mold growth.

### Health Benefits of Air Conditioning: Better Sleep

Another of the health benefits of air conditioning that might surprise you is better sleep. Sleep is so crucial for your overall health. It can help maintain healthy blood pressure levels, reduce stress, regulate weight and appetite, stabilize your mood, and even reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes. Yet, eight hours of solid sleep proves elusive for the millions of Americans who suffer from sleep disorders like insomnia.

One way to improve your sleep is to keep your bedroom at an optimum temperature. Most experts recommend keeping the bedroom between 60 and 67 degrees to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

### The Benefits of Family Protection Plans

When the summer reaches its peak, every household’s air conditioner is going at max capacity. This means that there is the potential for a large number of homes to experience AC breakdowns at around the same time. Consequently, all of the HVAC technicians in the area will be over-booked.

If your AC has broken down and it’s really hot, you need to get your home cooled off in a hurry. This is especially true if you have vulnerable elderly family members or young children at home. Because of this, you may want to enroll in Intelligent Design’s Family Protection Plan programs. Our Family Protection Plan members get priority service. We’ll guarantee that your family will get cooled down within 24 hours.

If your AC requires a part that we have to order from out of town, our technicians will hook up a portable AC to your home to get you cooled down in the meantime. If all of our portable ACs are already in use at other homes, we’ll put your family up in an air conditioned hotel. One way or another, we guarantee we will help you beat the heat.

To sign up for our Family Protection Plan, call Intelligent Design’s office in Tucson at [(520) 333 2665](tel:+15203332665). Each of our HVAC technicians is fully certified, with years of experience. We take a customer-first approach to AC maintenance and repair services.
