When contemplating AC replacement, you might find yourself with a plethora of questions. This is completely normal. Here, we address some of the most [frequently asked questions about AC](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-service-tucson/) replacement.

### **1\. How do I know when it’s time to replace my AC?**

Some signs indicate when it’s time for a replacement. If your air conditioning unit is over 10-15 years old, requires frequent [AC repairs](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/ac-repair-tucson/), doesn’t cool your home effectively, or your energy bills have skyrocketed, it may be time for a replacement.

### **2\. What size AC do I need for my home?**

The size of an HVAC system is determined by the square footage of your home. It’s crucial to get this right because a unit that’s too small won’t cool your home effectively, while one that’s too large can lead to excessive humidity. An Intelligent Design technician can assess your home and suggest the appropriate size.

### **3\. How long does it take to replace an AC unit?**

Typically, replacing an AC unit can take between 4 to 8 hours. However, this time can vary based on the complexity of the installation and the type of AC unit being installed.

### **4\. Can I replace my AC unit myself?**

While you might be tempted to turn this into a DIY project, AC replacement is a complex task that requires professional expertise. A trained technician from Intelligent Design will ensure the job is done correctly and safely.

### **5\. How often should I replace my AC unit?**

The average lifespan of an AC unit is around 10-15 years. However, with regular maintenance, some units can last even longer. It’s best to consult with an HVAC professional to assess the condition of your unit.

### **6\. Will a new AC unit lower my energy bills?**

Yes! Newer AC units are typically more energy-efficient than older ones. This means they can cool your home effectively while using less energy, which can significantly reduce your energy bills.
