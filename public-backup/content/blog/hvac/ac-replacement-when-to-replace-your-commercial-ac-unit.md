If you’re the owner of a commercial property, then one of your top concerns is keeping your building comfortable for tenants and employees. If you’re like most business owners, you probably rely on an air conditioning unit to do just that. But what happens when your AC starts to break down? Do you know when it’s time to replace the entire unit, or can you get away with simply repairing certain parts?

In this blog article, we will discuss the signs that it’s time for a new AC unit. We’ll also provide tips on choosing the right replacement unit for your business. Stay cool this summer with our helpful advice!

### What Is a Commercial AC Unit?

A commercial air conditioning unit is a system that is designed to cool and dehumidify the air in a commercial building. These units are usually much larger than residential units and have a more powerful cooling capacity.

Many businesses rely on commercial AC units to keep their employees comfortable and productive during the hot summer. The [HVAC system](https://www.idesignac.com/air-conditioning-tucson/) in a commercial building can be very complex, and the AC unit is an important part of that system.

Commercial AC units are typically located on the roof of a building. This allows for easy installation and maintenance. It also keeps the noise level down, as the compressors and fans in the AC unit can be quite loud. The central air system in a commercial building is often very different from the [AC system](https://www.idesignac.com/services/air-conditioning/) in a residential home.

### When to Replace Your Commercial AC Unit

Like any other piece of equipment, commercial AC units have a lifespan. Here are a few signs that it might be time to replace your unit:

1.  **Age** – The average lifespan of a commercial AC unit is 15-20 years. If your unit is approaching or has surpassed this age, it might be time for an upgrade, because it will be less energy-efficient and may not be able to keep up with your cooling demands.
2.  **Performance** – If you’ve noticed that your AC unit isn’t performing as well as it used to, it could be due for a replacement. Poor performance can manifest in several ways, such as the unit’s inability to reach the set temperature, uneven cooling, or excessive noise.
3.  **Increased energy bills** – One of the telltale signs of an inefficient AC unit is increased energy bills. If you’ve noticed that your cooling costs have gone up without a change in usage, it’s likely because your unit is struggling to do its job. A new, more energy-efficient unit can help you save money in the long run.
4.  **Wear and tear** – AC units experience wear and tear over time like any other equipment. This can lead to leaks, cracks, or further damage that affects the unit’s ability to function correctly.
5.  **Malfunctions** – If your unit isn’t working as it should be, or if it requires constant repairs, then it may be time to replace it. You don’t want to be without air conditioning in the middle of a heat wave, so keeping your unit in good working condition is important.

It might be time for [air conditioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning) replacement if you notice any of these signs in your AC unit. A new unit can help improve your comfort and save you money in the long run.

### How to Choose the Right Replacement Unit

When it’s time to replace your commercial AC unit, you must select the right replacement for your business. Here’s what you need to consider when making your decision.

#### Size

The replacement unit must be the proper size for the space. A unit that is too large will cycle on and off more frequently, which wastes energy and puts unnecessary wear and tear on the air conditioning system.

A unit that is too small will run constantly and still not keep the space cool enough, so the size must be proportional to the space it will be used in. The cooling system must also handle the heat generated by the business. For example, if you have a restaurant, the AC system must deal with body heat, cooking heat, and possibly even sunlight through the windows.

#### Energy Efficiency

A more energy-efficient unit will use less electricity to run, which saves money on utility bills. It’s important to compare the annual operating cost of different units before making your purchase.

When browsing new air conditioner units, look for the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating. The higher the SEER rating, the more energy-efficient the unit is. The heating and cooling costs for a commercial building can be very high, so choosing an energy-efficient AC unit is essential.

#### Features

Some features that may be important to you include:

*   Dehumidification capabilities
*   Programmability
*   Air filtration
*   Quiet operation

Be sure to select a unit with features that will meet the needs of your business. A new HVAC system is a significant investment, so you want to be sure you’re getting the features you need.

#### Price

You’ll also need to consider the price when selecting a replacement unit, but remember that the lowest-priced option isn’t always the best deal in the long run. Be sure to compare the features, SEER rating, and annual operating costs of different units before making your final decision. Include the installation costs in your budget as well.

If you keep these factors in mind, you’ll be sure to choose the right replacement unit for your commercial AC system.

### How to Properly Maintain Your New AC Unit

You’ve just replaced your commercial AC unit, and it’s time to start thinking about maintaining it properly. Here are a few tips:

#### Tip #1 – Change your filter

Changing the filter is the simplest and most important maintenance task for your HVAC unit. A clogged or dirty filter will make your unit work harder, leading to expensive repairs down the road. Check your filter monthly, and change it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

#### Tip #2 – Keep the area around your unit clean

One of the biggest enemies of your commercial AC unit is dirt. Over time, dirt and debris can build up on the coils and fins of your unit, causing it to work harder and less efficiently. To help keep your unit running properly, regularly clean the area around it, including the coils and fins. You can do this yourself or hire a professional to do it for you.

#### Tip #3 – Keep your coils clean

The coils in your AC unit are responsible for transferring heat from the air inside your building to the outside air. If the coils become dirty, they will not be able to transfer heat properly, and your AC unit will have to work harder to cool your building. Cleaning the coils regularly will help extend the life of your AC unit.

#### Tip #4 – Ensure your dryer vent is not angled toward your AC unit

Your dryer vent should be angled away from your AC unit to prevent lint and debris from building up on the coils. If your dryer vent is angled toward your AC unit, it can cause the unit to overheat and break down prematurely.

#### Tip #5 – Check your ductwork and seal open spaces

Open spaces in your ductwork can also lead to increased energy costs and decreased efficiency. Inspect your ductwork regularly and seal any openings or gaps that you find. This will help keep your AC unit running at peak efficiency.

#### Tip #6 – Professional air conditioner maintenance

In addition to the tips above, it’s also a good idea to have your AC unit professionally serviced at least once a year. With our help, you can be sure that your new AC unit is properly maintained and will last for years to come.

These are just a few tips to help you maintain your commercial AC unit. By following these tips, you can help extend the life of your unit and keep it running efficiently.

### Conclusion

There are a few key indicators that it’s time to start shopping for a new commercial AC unit. If your unit is more than 15 years old, isn’t cooling your building properly, or is costing you more to operate each year, it may be time for a replacement.
