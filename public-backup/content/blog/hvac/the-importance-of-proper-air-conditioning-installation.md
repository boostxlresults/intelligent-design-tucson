### Intelligent Design DNA

When it’s time to schedule air conditioning installation to replace your old AC system, you might think that the most important decision is figuring out what type of AC unit to buy. But in fact, the make, model, and energy efficiency rating of your new system isn’t as important as the company you choose for the AC installation. Whether or not your AC is installed correctly will have a significant influence on its energy efficiency, overall performance, and lifespan. Yet, up to 90% of the ACs in Arizona homes are installed incorrectly. This can result in significant problems for Arizona homeowners, such as the following.

### Poor Energy Efficiency from Improper Air Conditioning Installation

It’s often thought that the larger an air conditioner is, the more energy efficient it is. However, this isn’t the case. An oversized air conditioner will short cycle, which refers to turning on and off frequently. This is a major energy waster. If your system is oversized, you will have high electric bills and a larger carbon footprint—not an ideal situation for either the environment or your wallet.

When you choose an experienced, established company to perform your AC installation, you can rest assured they will size the unit properly. An experienced installer should take the time to accurately measure your home in order to recommend the right size of unit for you.

### Increased Repair Costs and Lower Longevity

Another major problem with an improper air conditioning installation is that you will end up paying far more in repair costs. Poorly installed air conditioners tend to break down more frequently, leading to inconvenience and higher expenses. Furthermore, when a subpar company performs the AC installation, the unit itself is likely to have a shorter lifespan. This means you’ll end up paying thousands to replace the unit sooner than you should have to.

### Uneven Comfort Levels from an Incorrect AC Installation

A poorly installed central air conditioner is likely to have airflow problems. In fact, you will probably notice that there are uneven hot and cold pockets throughout your home. One floor or one room might seem hotter or colder than the others, for example. When you choose an established company to install your AC, you’ll enjoy even comfort levels throughout your home.
