It’s the middle of summer, and AC repair is probably the last thing on your mind. But, believe it or not, AC repair is one of the most common household repairs. This blog post will discuss the four most common AC repairs and what you can expect during each one.

## **Most Common Air Conditioning Problems and Repair**

### **Air Conditioner Compressor Replacement**

If your air conditioner isn’t working as well as it used to, one of the most common ac repairs is air conditioner compressor replacement. The compressor is the heart of the air conditioning unit and pumps refrigerant through the system.

If the compressor fails, the entire AC unit will shut down. Replacing a faulty compressor is a significant repair, but it’s also one of the most effective ways to get your AC unit up and running again.

In most cases, you’ll need to replace the entire AC unit, including the evaporator coil. This repair can be expensive, but having a functional AC unit during the hot summer months is worth it.

### **AC Condenser Replacement**

One of the most common air conditioner repairs is AC condenser replacement. The air conditioner condenser is responsible for removing hot air from your home. If the air conditioner condenser is not working correctly, it can cause your air conditioner to work harder and longer to cool your home, leading to higher energy bills.

In some cases, replacing the entire air conditioner unit may be necessary. However, in most cases, a new air conditioner condenser can be installed without replacing the entire unit. You can reduce the risk of this issue by having your air conditioner serviced by a qualified technician every two years to ensure that it is operating correctly and to prevent any future problems.

### **AC Unit Freon Recharge**

Freon is the coolant used in air conditioners to remove warm air from your home and replace it with cool air. Over time, Freon can leak out of air conditioners, making them less effective at cooling your home. If you think your air conditioner may be low on Freon, you must call a qualified AC repair technician.

They can safely recharge your air conditioner, restoring it to full capacity. In some cases, a Freon recharge may be all that is needed to get your air conditioner back up and running. However, if your air conditioner is old or has sustained significant damage, you may need to install a new unit.

Central air systems are one of the most commonly used air conditioning systems. They are composed of an outdoor unit that contains the compressor and condenser coils and an indoor unit that houses the evaporator coils. Central air systems are typically more expensive than window units but are also more efficient.

### **AC Expansion Valve Repair**

If your central air unit isn’t working properly, one of the most common repairs is an ac expansion valve repair. This involves replacing the valve controlling the coolant flow to the evaporator coil.

Your air conditioner can cool your home sufficiently with a properly functioning expansion valve. In addition, a faulty expansion valve can cause your air conditioner to freeze up, damaging the unit and leading to more extensive repairs.

If you suspect your expansion valve needs to be replaced, you must call a qualified AC repair technician as soon as possible. Otherwise, you could end up facing high repair costs down the road.

## **What to Expect on Your AC Repair**

Most people don’t think about their air conditioner until it stops working. Then, they’re scrambling to find an AC repair service to come out and take a look. But what should you expect when the repair person arrives?

First, they’ll want to take a look at your unit to determine what the problem is. This may involve checking the air filter or something more complicated like Freon levels or electrical issues. Once they identify the problem, they’ll give you an estimate of the AC repair cost.

Remember that AC repair costs can vary depending on the severity of the problem and the type of unit you have. However, depending on the damage, most repairs fall between $100 and $250 or more. If the repair person finds that your unit is beyond repair, they may recommend replacing it entirely.

## **How to Save on Your AC Repair Cost**

### **Yearly Inspection**

As the weather gets warmer, many of us start thinking about how to save on our air conditioning costs. One way to do this is to have your AC system serviced and inspected by a qualified AC technician at least once a year.

This will ensure that your air conditioning equipment is operating efficiently and that any potential problems are caught early before they result in expensive repairs.

In addition, regular servicing can help extend your AC unit’s life, saving you even more money in the long run. So, schedule an annual AC tune-up if you want to keep your cool this summer without breaking the bank.

### **Follow the Manufacturer’s Maintenance Schedule** 

If your central air conditioner is more than 12 years old, replacing it with a new, high-efficiency model could cut your cooling costs by 30% or more. But if you can’t afford a new air conditioner, there are other ways to save on your AC repair costs.

One of the best ways to save money is to follow the AC manufacturer’s maintenance schedule. Regularly cleaning and inspecting your air conditioner can extend its life and avoid costly repairs.

Additionally, ensuring that your air handler is appropriately sized for your home can help reduce wear and tear on the unit. Lastly, keep your filters clean and clear of debris to ensure optimal airflow and efficiency. Following these simple tips, you can keep your AC repair costs down and enjoy cool, comfortable air all summer.
