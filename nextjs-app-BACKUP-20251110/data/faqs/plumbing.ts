  serviceName: 'Trenchless Repair',
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is trenchless pipe repair?",
      answer: "Trenchless pipe repair fixes underground pipes without traditional excavation using two main methods: pipe lining (inserting epoxy-coated liner that hardens into a new pipe inside the old one) and pipe bursting (breaking old pipe while simultaneously pulling new pipe through). Both methods require only small access points rather than full trenching."
    },
    {
      question: "How does trenchless repair compare to traditional excavation in value?",
      answer: "While trenchless repair costs more initially than traditional excavation, total costs are often lower when factoring in landscaping restoration, hardscaping replacement, and disruption savings. In Tucson, preserving desert landscaping and expensive pavers makes trenchless extremely cost-effective overall. The investment provides a longer-lasting solution with minimal property damage and faster completion time."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of trenchless repair for Tucson homes?",
      answer: "Trenchless repair preserves desert landscaping and expensive hardscaping (pavers, decorative rock, mature cacti and trees), completes faster (1-2 days vs. 5-7 days), causes minimal property disruption, creates stronger, seamless pipes, and eliminates costly landscape restoration. For Tucson's desert yards, preservation is invaluable."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does trenchless pipe repair last?",
      answer: "Trenchless epoxy pipe lining typically lasts 50+ years, often outlasting the home itself.

Faster completion means less disruption to your daily life."
    },
    {
      question: "Will trenchless repair work for sewer lines with tree root problems?",
      answer: "Yes, trenchless pipe lining is excellent for root-damaged pipes. Roots are first cleared, then epoxy lining creates a seamless interior that prevents future root intrusion. This is especially valuable in Tucson where palo verde, mesquite, and other desert trees have aggressive root systems that constantly seek water in sewer pipes."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between pipe lining and pipe bursting?",
      answer: "Pipe lining inserts epoxy-coated liner inside existing pipes, creating a new pipe within the old one. Pipe bursting breaks apart the old pipe while simultaneously pulling new pipe through the same path. Lining is less disruptive and ideal for many situations. Bursting is better when pipes are severely deteriorated or upsizing is needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Does trenchless repair require permits?",
      answer: "Yes, trenchless sewer and water line repairs require permits in Tucson. We handle all permitting and coordinate required inspections with local authorities. Despite being less invasive than traditional methods, trenchless work still involves critical infrastructure requiring proper oversight and code compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can trenchless repair fix pipes under my house foundation?",
      answer: "Yes, trenchless methods are ideal for pipes under foundations, driveways, and buildings where excavation would be extremely disruptive or costly. Small access points at each end allow complete repair without disturbing the structure. This makes trenchless perfect for slab leak repairs and sewer lines beneath Tucson homes."
    },
    {
      question: "What warranty comes with trenchless pipe repair?",
      answer: "We provide comprehensive warranties on trenchless repairs, typically 10-25 years on workmanship depending on repair method. Epoxy lining manufacturers often provide 50-year material warranties. We stand behind the quality and longevity of trenchless solutions and will clearly explain all warranty terms before work begins."

    {
      question: "What is a rooter service?",
      answer: "Rooter service uses professional drain-cleaning equipment (motorized augers) to clear tree roots, severe clogs, and blockages from sewer and drain lines. The rotating cable with cutting blades breaks through obstructions and scrapes pipe walls clean. It's more powerful than hand snaking and ideal for stubborn blockages common in Tucson's aging infrastructure."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the Rooter Special pricing?",
      answer: "Our Rooter Special pricing varies by location and current promotions. It includes professional main sewer line clearing, standard cable length, and basic video inspection. Additional services like extended cable, hydro-jetting, or extensive root removal may incur additional charges. Contact us for current special pricing and to schedule service."

    {
      question: "What's included in Intelligent Design's Rooter Special?",
      answer: "Our Rooter Special includes professional main sewer line clearing with industrial-grade equipment, removal of roots and blockages, basic video inspection to verify clearing, and expert assessment of pipe condition. We'll identify the cause of blockages and recommend solutions to prevent future issues. Same-day service is usually available."
    },
    {
      question: "How is rooter service different from regular drain cleaning?",
      answer: "Regular drain cleaning handles simple clogs in fixtures using hand augers or chemicals. Rooter service uses powerful motorized equipment to clear main sewer lines, remove tree roots, and handle severe blockages that hand tools can't address. It's heavy-duty service for serious drainage problems affecting your entire home."
    },
    {
      question: "Can rooter service remove tree roots from my sewer line?",
      answer: "Yes, rooter service is specifically designed to cut through and remove tree roots from sewer lines. The rotating cutting blades effectively clear roots from palo verde, mesquite, and other desert trees common in Tucson. However, roots will return unless pipes are repaired or lined to prevent re-intrusion."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does rooter service take?",
      answer: "Most rooter service appointments take 1-2 hours depending on blockage severity and location. Simple root clearing may be completed in under an hour, while extensive blockages or multiple problem areas can take 2-3 hours. We work efficiently to restore your drainage quickly and thoroughly."
    },
    {
      question: "How often will I need rooter service?",
      answer: "Frequency depends on the cause of blockages. Homes with tree root problems may need annual or semi-annual service until pipes are lined or replaced. Homes without systemic issues may never need routine rooter service. After service, we'll recommend preventive measures to minimize future needs."
    },
    {
      question: "Will rooter service damage my pipes?",
      answer: "When performed by experienced professionals, rooter service is safe for pipes. Our technicians use appropriate blade sizes and techniques for different pipe materials and diameters. Older cast iron or severely deteriorated pipes (common in Tucson homes built before 1980) may already be damaged—rooter service simply reveals existing issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes main sewer line blockages in Tucson?",
      answer: "Common causes include tree root intrusion from desert vegetation, mineral buildup from hard water, grease accumulation, foreign objects, and deteriorating cast iron pipes in older homes. Tucson's combination of aggressive tree roots, hard water, and aging infrastructure makes main line blockages relatively common."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer guarantees on rooter service?",
      answer: "Yes, we stand behind our rooter service work. If the same blockage returns within the warranty period (typically 30 days), we'll return to address it at no additional charge. This guarantee doesn't cover new blockages or root regrowth in damaged pipes. Specific warranty terms are explained before service."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a camera inspection with rooter service?",
      answer: "Yes, camera inspection is highly recommended after rooter service, especially if you experience frequent blockages. Video inspection reveals the root cause—deteriorating pipes, severe root intrusion, bellied sections, or other issues. This information helps you make informed decisions about permanent solutions versus ongoing maintenance."

export const waterSoftenersFAQs: ServiceFAQs = {
  serviceId: 'water-softeners',
  serviceName: 'Water Softeners',
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Why do I need a water softener in Tucson?",
      answer: "Tucson has extremely hard water (13-15 grains per gallon, among the hardest in the nation). Hard water causes scale buildup in pipes and appliances, shortens water heater life by 40%, reduces appliance efficiency, leaves spots on dishes and fixtures, makes soap less effective, and can dry out skin and hair. Water softeners solve all these problems."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine water softener installation costs?",
      answer: "Installation costs depend on system size and capacity needed for your household, features selected (basic vs. premium models), installation complexity, and whether additional plumbing modifications are required. Quality whole-home systems include equipment and professional installation. While the initial investment is significant, softeners quickly pay for themselves through extended appliance life, reduced cleaning product use, and lower energy bills."
    },
    {
      question: "How does a water softener work?",
      answer: "Water softeners use ion exchange to remove hardness minerals (calcium and magnesium) from water. Hard water flows through resin beads that attract and trap hardness minerals, releasing sodium ions in exchange. Periodically, the system regenerates by flushing concentrated salt solution through the resin to recharge it for continued softening."
    },
    {
      question: "What size water softener do I need for my Tucson home?",
      answer: "Sizing depends on household size, daily water usage, and hardness level. A family of four typically needs a 32,000-48,000 grain capacity system for Tucson's extremely hard water. Our technicians calculate precise requirements based on your water usage patterns, number of occupants, and hardness test results to ensure optimal performance."
    },
    {
      question: "What savings do water softeners provide?",
      answer: "Water softeners provide substantial ongoing savings through extended appliance lifespan (water heaters last significantly longer with softened water), dramatically reduced soap and detergent usage, fewer cleaning products needed, lower energy bills from efficient appliances, and fewer plumbing repairs. In Tucson's extremely hard water environment, water softeners typically provide excellent return on investment through these combined savings."
    },
    {
      question: "Do water softeners require maintenance?",
      answer: "Water softeners require minimal maintenance—primarily adding salt monthly to the brine tank. Annual professional service includes cleaning the brine tank, checking resin bed, inspecting valves and seals, and ensuring optimal regeneration cycles. This simple maintenance ensures decades of reliable performance. Salt is inexpensive and readily available at most hardware stores."
    },
    {
      question: "Will soft water feel different?",
      answer: "Yes, soft water feels noticeably different—more slippery in the shower and creates richer soap lather. This is normal and indicates the softener is working properly. The slippery feel is actually your skin being clean without hard water mineral film. Most people prefer soft water after a brief adjustment period."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I drink softened water?",
      answer: "Softened water is safe to drink. However, the softening process adds small amounts of sodium (about 20-50mg per 8oz glass in Tucson's hard water). People on sodium-restricted diets may prefer unsoftened water for drinking. We can install a bypass for kitchen cold water or recommend whole-home filtration for drinking water."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between water softeners and water filters?",
      answer: "Water softeners remove hardness minerals using ion exchange. Water filters remove contaminants, sediment, chlorine, and taste/odor issues using filtration media. For Tucson homes, softeners address hardness while filters improve taste and remove specific contaminants. Many homes benefit from both systems working together."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do water softeners last?",
      answer: "Quality water softeners typically last 15-20+ years with proper maintenance. The resin bed (the core softening component) can last 10-15 years before needing replacement. Regular professional service and keeping the brine tank clean maximize lifespan. Many Tucson homes have original softeners still functioning after 20+ years."
    },
    {
      question: "What brands of water softeners do you install?",
      answer: "We install premium water softener brands including Water Boss, Culligan, Kinetico, and other high-quality systems proven effective in Tucson's extremely hard water. Each brand offers different features, efficiency levels, and warranties. Our experts help you choose the best system for your household size, budget, and water quality goals."

    {
      question: "What types of water filtration systems do you install?",
      answer: "We install whole-home filtration systems, reverse osmosis (RO) under-sink systems, point-of-use filters, UV purification systems, and combination softener-filter systems. Each addresses different concerns—whole-home filters remove sediment and chlorine, RO systems remove contaminants for drinking water, and UV kills bacteria. We'll recommend the best solution for your needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors determine water filtration installation costs?",
      answer: "Costs vary by system type selected (under-sink RO, whole-home filtration, or advanced multi-stage with UV), installation complexity, and features needed. More comprehensive systems covering the entire home cost more than point-of-use systems. While initial investment varies, filtered water provides superior quality and convenience compared to bottled water. We provide transparent quotes that break down all factors."
    },
    {
      question: "What contaminants does water filtration remove?",
      answer: "Filtration systems remove various contaminants depending on type: sediment, chlorine, chloramines, heavy metals (lead, mercury), pesticides, herbicides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and microorganisms. Reverse osmosis removes 95-99% of dissolved solids. We can test your Tucson water and recommend filtration addressing your specific concerns."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Tucson tap water safe to drink?",
      answer: "Yes, Tucson tap water meets all EPA safety standards and is generally safe to drink. However, it contains chlorine for disinfection, hardness minerals, and trace contaminants. Many people prefer the taste and peace of mind from filtered water. Filtration removes chlorine taste, reduces mineral content, and provides additional contaminant protection."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between water filtration and water softening?",
      answer: "Water softeners specifically remove hardness minerals (calcium and magnesium) using ion exchange. Water filters remove contaminants, sediment, chlorine, taste and odor compounds using physical filtration. Tucson homes often benefit from both—softeners protect plumbing and appliances, while filters improve drinking water quality and taste."
    },
    {
      question: "Do water filtration systems require maintenance?",
      answer: "Yes, filtration systems require periodic filter replacement to maintain effectiveness. Under-sink RO systems need filter changes every 6-12 months and membrane replacement every 2-3 years. Whole-home filters need replacement every 3-12 months depending on type and usage. Regular maintenance is affordable and ensures optimal water quality. We offer maintenance plans covering all filter replacements."
    },
    {
      question: "How does reverse osmosis work?",
      answer: "Reverse osmosis (RO) forces water through a semi-permeable membrane that blocks contaminants while allowing pure water molecules to pass through. Multi-stage RO systems include pre-filters (remove sediment and chlorine), the RO membrane (removes 95-99% of dissolved contaminants), and post-filters (polish taste). The result is extremely pure drinking water."
    },
    {
      question: "Will filtered water taste better than Tucson tap water?",
      answer: "Yes, most people notice significant taste improvement with filtered water. Filtration removes chlorine (which causes chemical taste), reduces mineral content, and eliminates odor compounds. Many compare the taste to premium bottled water. The improvement is especially noticeable in coffee, tea, and ice, which highlight water quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Can water filtration remove hard water minerals?",
      answer: "Standard filtration doesn't effectively remove hardness minerals. Reverse osmosis removes minerals but is typically used only for drinking water due to water waste. For whole-home hardness removal, water softeners are the right solution. We often recommend combining whole-home softener with point-of-use RO for comprehensive water treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "How much water does reverse osmosis waste?",
      answer: "Traditional RO systems waste 3-5 gallons per gallon of purified water produced. Modern efficient RO systems reduce waste to 1-2 gallons per gallon purified. While this seems wasteful, RO is typically used only for drinking and cooking (1-2% of household water), making the actual impact minimal compared to benefits of pure drinking water."
    },
    {
      question: "Do water filtration systems reduce water pressure?",
      answer: "Properly sized whole-home filtration systems have minimal impact on water pressure. Under-sink RO systems create their own water pressure for the dedicated faucet and don't affect home pressure. If pressure drops occur, it usually indicates clogged filters needing replacement. We size systems appropriately to maintain good flow and pressure."

  serviceName: 'Garbage Disposal Installation & Repair',
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What factors affect garbage disposal installation costs?",
      answer: "Installation costs depend on unit quality selected (horsepower, features, brand), installation complexity, and whether electrical work is needed. Premium models with larger motors and advanced features like anti-jam mechanisms cost more. All installations include the disposal unit, professional installation, electrical connections, and proper drain hookup. We provide transparent pricing with quality warranties."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a garbage disposal last in Tucson?",
      answer: "Quality garbage disposals typically last 10-15 years with proper use and maintenance. Tucson's hard water can accelerate wear on internal components, making regular cleaning important. Premium models with corrosion-resistant grind chambers last longer. Professional installation and avoiding common misuse (like grinding fibrous foods) maximize disposal lifespan."
    },
    {
      question: "What size garbage disposal do I need?",
      answer: "Disposal size depends on household size and cooking habits. A 1/2 HP disposal works for 1-2 people with light use. A 3/4 HP model suits most families of 3-4 people. Large families or heavy users should choose 1 HP or higher. We'll recommend appropriate sizing based on your cooking patterns and family size."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is my garbage disposal humming but not working?",
      answer: "A humming disposal indicates the motor is receiving power but the flywheel is jammed, usually from foreign objects, food buildup, or internal component failure. We can often resolve jams by manually rotating the flywheel or removing obstructions. If internal components have failed, replacement may be more cost-effective than repair on older units."
    },
    {
      question: "What foods should never go in a garbage disposal?",
      answer: "Never put fibrous vegetables (celery, asparagus, corn husks), expandable foods (pasta, rice, bread), grease or oil, bones, fruit pits, eggshells, coffee grounds, potato peels, or non-food items in disposals. These cause clogs, dull blades, or damage motors. In Tucson's hard water, mineral buildup accelerates with improper food disposal habits."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you fix a leaking garbage disposal?",
      answer: "Disposal leaks come from worn gaskets, loose mounting assemblies, cracked housings, or deteriorated drain connections. We can repair leaks from gaskets and connections, but cracked housings require disposal replacement. Given disposal age and repair costs, replacement often makes more sense than repairing leaks on units over 8-10 years old."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does garbage disposal installation take?",
      answer: "Standard garbage disposal installation typically takes 1-2 hours for straightforward replacements. New installations requiring electrical circuit addition or drain modifications may take 2-4 hours. We work efficiently to minimize disruption while ensuring proper electrical connections, secure mounting, and leak-free drain hookup."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you remove and dispose of old garbage disposals?",
      answer: "Yes, removal and proper disposal of your old unit is included in our installation service. We disconnect the old disposal safely, remove it completely, and dispose of it in compliance with environmental regulations. We leave your kitchen clean and ready to use with your new disposal functioning perfectly."

Each offers different horsepower options, noise levels, warranty coverage, and special features like anti-jam mechanisms or sound insulation. Our experts help you choose the best model for your household needs and budget."
    },
    {
      question: "Can garbage disposals handle Tucson's hard water?",
      answer: "Yes, but Tucson's extremely hard water (13-15 grains) can accelerate mineral buildup inside disposals. We recommend models with corrosion-resistant stainless steel grind chambers and components. Regular cleaning with ice cubes and citrus peels helps prevent mineral accumulation. Water softeners dramatically reduce hard water impact on all plumbing fixtures."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prevent garbage disposal odors?",
      answer: "Prevent odors by running cold water before, during, and after disposal use, grinding ice cubes and citrus peels weekly to clean and freshen, avoiding food buildup by thoroughly grinding all waste, and cleaning the splash guard regularly. Never put grease down disposals, as it traps food particles causing odors."
    },
    {
      question: "Do garbage disposals require special electrical work?",
      answer: "Disposals require dedicated 120-volt electrical circuits with GFCI protection when installed under sinks. Most modern Tucson homes have appropriate wiring, but older homes may need electrical upgrades. Our licensed electricians (ROC 340962, 322375, 296386, 276673) handle all electrical requirements safely and to code during installation."

We help you choose based on household needs."
    },
    {
      question: "What causes toilets to run constantly?",
      answer: "Running toilets usually result from worn flapper valves, faulty fill valves, incorrect float adjustments, or chain issues preventing proper flapper sealing. Tucson's hard water accelerates component deterioration, especially rubber parts. We diagnose the exact cause and replace worn components. Running toilets waste 30-200 gallons daily, significantly increasing water bills."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you repair toilet leaks?",
      answer: "Yes, we repair all toilet leaks including base leaks (wax ring failure), tank-to-bowl leaks (deteriorated gaskets), supply line leaks, and internal component leaks. Base leaks require toilet removal and wax ring replacement. If toilet age, multiple issues, or severe damage exist, replacement may be more economical than extensive repairs."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my toilet keep clogging?",
      answer: "Frequent clogs indicate insufficient flush power, partial drain blockage, vent issues, or flushing inappropriate items. Older low-flow toilets (pre-2005) often have weak flush performance. Tree roots, mineral buildup from hard water, or foreign objects in drain lines cause chronic clogs. We diagnose the root cause—sometimes replacing old toilets with modern high-efficiency models solves chronic clogging."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you install water-efficient toilets?",
      answer: "Yes, we specialize in high-efficiency toilets (HETs) using 1.28 gallons per flush or less (vs. 3.5-7 gallons in older models). Modern HETs provide powerful flushing while saving 20-60% on water usage—crucial in Tucson's desert environment. Many qualify for utility rebates. We install EPA WaterSense certified models offering maximum efficiency without sacrificing performance."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between one-piece and two-piece toilets?",
      answer: "One-piece toilets integrate tank and bowl in a single unit—easier to clean with sleeker appearance but more expensive and heavier. Two-piece toilets have separate tanks and bowls—lower cost, easier to transport and install, with readily available replacement parts. Both perform equally well; choice depends on budget, aesthetics, and ease of cleaning preferences."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a toilet last?",
      answer: "Quality toilets can last 25-50+ years with proper maintenance. However, internal components (flappers, fill valves, flush valves) require replacement every 5-10 years, especially in Tucson's hard water. Chronic repairs, cracks, wobbling, or persistent leaks on older toilets often warrant replacement with modern water-efficient models offering better performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle toilet installations for ADA compliance?",
      answer: "Yes, we install ADA-compliant comfort-height toilets (17-19 inch seat height) meeting accessibility standards. We ensure proper placement, clearances, and grab bar blocking if requested. ADA-compliant toilets benefit elderly users, people with mobility limitations, and meet requirements for commercial properties and rental units."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you fix a rocking or wobbly toilet?",
      answer: "Yes, rocking toilets usually result from uneven floors, deteriorated wax rings, or loose mounting bolts. We level and shim toilets properly, replace wax rings, and secure mounting. Severely uneven floors may require additional floor work. Rocking toilets compromise wax ring seals and cause leaks, so prompt repair prevents water damage to subfloors."
