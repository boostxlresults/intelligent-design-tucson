Our intense UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations (40°F daily swings common), violent monsoon winds, and occasional winter freezes create conditions that test roofing systems beyond typical performance standards. We understand how to select materials optimized for Southern Arizona's climate, install them using techniques that account for thermal expansion and movement, ensure proper ventilation and insulation for energy efficiency, and create roofing systems that protect your home for 30-50+ years."

Clay tiles offer authentic beauty, 50+ year lifespan, exceptional heat reflection (reducing cooling costs 20-30%), superior fire resistance (Class A rating), and wind resistance up to 150 mph when properly installed. We install Spanish/S-tile profiles, mission tile profiles, flat tile systems, and custom specialty tiles. Clay tiles cost $10-$18 per square foot installed but deliver lifetime value through longevity, energy savings, and home value enhancement."

            "content": "Concrete tiles provide similar performance and appearance to clay at reduced cost ($8-$12 per square foot). Modern concrete tiles feature integral coloring that won't fade, lighter weight than traditional concrete tiles (though still requiring reinforced framing), and diverse color and profile options. Both clay and concrete tiles require proper installation including adequate roof pitch (minimum 3:12), reinforced framing to support weight (9-12 pounds per square foot), high-quality underlayment (minimum 30-pound felt or synthetic), proper batten systems for ventilation and tile support, and expert flashing at all penetrations and transitions."

We're certified installers for major tile manufacturers, qualifying your project for enhanced warranties."

            "content": "Architectural composition shingles offer excellent value for budget-conscious new construction. Premium shingles provide 25-50 year performance at $4-$7 per square foot installed, significantly less than tile. Modern architectural shingles feature dimensional profiles that mimic tile or wood shake appearance, algae-resistant formulations, impact resistance for hail protection, and cool roof options with reflective granules that reduce cooling costs. Quality shingle installation delivers reliable weather protection and attractive appearance for decades."

            "type": "paragraph",

Our shingle installation incorporates ice and water shield at valleys and edges, synthetic underlayment for superior tear resistance and weatherproofing, proper shingle alignment and nailing patterns to resist wind uplift, dimensional ridge cap shingles for professional appearance, and complete flashing systems. While shingles don't last as long as tile in Tucson's intense sun, proper installation and premium materials deliver 20-30 years of dependable performance."

Standing seam metal roofs provide sleek appearance, 40-60 year lifespan, exceptional energy efficiency (reflecting 60-70% of solar radiation), zero maintenance requirements, and recyclability at end of life. Metal roofing suits low-slope applications where tile isn't appropriate and handles thermal expansion expertly through panel design. Installation costs range $7-$15 per square foot depending on metal type (steel, aluminum, copper) and complexity."

Our metal roof installations include proper thermal breaks to prevent heat transfer, expansion joints for thermal movement, comprehensive flashing systems, and factory-finish options in numerous colors. Metal roofing pairs excellently with solar panel installations common on Tucson new construction."

We install TPO single-ply membranes (white reflective surface reduces cooling costs significantly), EPDM rubber membranes, modified bitumen systems, and spray polyurethane foam roofing. Each system requires different installation techniques, proper slope for drainage (minimum 1/4 inch per foot), comprehensive flashing and edging, and quality control during installation. We're certified installers ensuring proper technique and warranty coverage for flat roofing systems."

            "content": "Energy-efficient roofing dramatically reduces cooling costs in Tucson's climate where air conditioning operates 6-9 months annually. Cool roof technology—highly reflective roofing materials that reflect solar radiation rather than absorbing it—can reduce roof surface temperatures by 50-80°F compared to traditional dark roofs. Light-colored tile, cool roof shingles, white TPO membranes, and reflective metal roofing all qualify as cool roofs. The resulting cooling cost savings can reach 20-30% annually, paying back any premium cost within 5-7 years."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "Proper attic ventilation is equally critical for energy efficiency. We design ventilation systems using ridge vents for exhaust, soffit vents for intake, adequate ventilation area (1 square foot per 150 square feet of attic space), and balanced intake/exhaust ratios. Proper ventilation expels superheated attic air before it radiates into living spaces, extends roofing material life by reducing thermal stress, prevents moisture accumulation, and can reduce cooling costs 10-15%. Many builders undersize ventilation—we ensure adequate capacity."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "Radiant barriers—reflective materials installed in attics—reduce radiant heat transfer by 40-60%, further lowering cooling costs. We recommend and install radiant barriers beneath roof decking or over attic insulation. Combined with cool roofing, proper ventilation, and adequate attic insulation, comprehensive energy-efficient roofing systems can reduce cooling costs 30-40% compared to conventional systems. Tucson Electric Power and Southwest Gas offer rebates for energy-efficient roofing and insulation—we help maximize available incentives."
