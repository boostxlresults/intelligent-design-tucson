Nest's Farsight feature lights up when you approach, displaying temperature or time. Energy history shows exactly how much energy you're using and why. Auto-Schedule learns your preferred temperatures and creates a custom schedule. Home/Away Assist uses your phone's location to automatically switch to energy-saving mode when everyone leaves.

The SmartThermostat with Voice Control has built-in Alexa, allowing you to stream music, check weather, or control other smart devices without a separate Echo device. SmartSensor technology is where Ecobee really shines—included remote sensors placed in bedrooms or other rooms measure temperature and occupancy throughout your home, ensuring comfort in the rooms you actually use rather than just where the thermostat is located. This is particularly valuable in Tucson homes where sunny west-facing rooms can be significantly hotter than other areas. The more budget-friendly Ecobee3 Lite offers excellent scheduling and remote control without the voice assistant functionality."
