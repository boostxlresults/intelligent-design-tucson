Desert dust, pollen, bird droppings, and pollution create a film on panels that blocks sunlight and reduces efficiency. Even a thin layer of dust can decrease output by 10-15%, while heavy soiling can reduce production by 25-35%. Our professional cleaning services use deionized water and soft-brush techniques that safely remove contaminants without scratching panels or voiding warranties.
