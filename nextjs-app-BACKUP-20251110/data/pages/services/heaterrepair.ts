            "content": "Understanding why heaters fail helps you recognize problems early. If your heater won't turn on at all, the issue could be electrical—from a tripped breaker to a faulty thermostat or blown fuse. Heaters draw significant power, especially during startup, and electrical issues are among the most common causes of heating system failures."
      },
      {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "Dirty or clogged components are another frequent culprit. Air filters clogged with dust and debris restrict airflow, forcing your heater to work harder and potentially overheat. Burners covered in soot or debris won't heat efficiently. Regular maintenance prevents many of these issues, but when problems arise, professional heater repair is essential."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "Mechanical wear and tear affects older heating systems. Blower motors, belts, bearings, and other moving parts eventually wear out. Strange noises—grinding, squealing, or banging—often indicate mechanical problems requiring immediate attention. Ignoring these sounds can lead to complete system failure and costly emergency repairs."
