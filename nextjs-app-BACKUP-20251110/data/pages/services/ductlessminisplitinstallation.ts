Modern systems achieve SEER ratings of 18-30+, compared to 13-16 SEER for conventional central AC. This translates to 30-50% lower cooling costs—a significant savings when your AC runs 8+ months per year in Arizona's climate."

No ductwork means zero energy loss from duct leakage, which typically wastes 20-30% of cooling in traditional systems. Many Tucson homeowners see their electricity bills drop by hundreds of dollars annually after switching to ductless mini splits."
