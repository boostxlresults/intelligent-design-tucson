Air conditioners require large surges of power to run and can trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse—especially during summer heat waves when the unit may be running almost nonstop."

If components become clogged with dirt or moisture, air cannot move properly throughout your system. Components may become damaged by these types of clogs and buildup. As a result, you may notice less air flowing through your vents or vents blowing air that is not cool enough."
