We evaluate roof orientation (south-facing is optimal), pitch, condition, and any shading issues from Picture Rocks's scenic mountain views or mature landscaping. Using satellite imagery and specialized software, we model sun exposure throughout the year to estimate production."

Typical Picture Rocks homeowners save $1,200-$2,400 annually, totaling $30,000-$60,000 over 25 years. The 30% federal tax credit immediately reduces system cost by thousands of dollars, shortening payback periods to 7-10 years."

By generating your own electricity, you lock in predictable energy costs for decades."
