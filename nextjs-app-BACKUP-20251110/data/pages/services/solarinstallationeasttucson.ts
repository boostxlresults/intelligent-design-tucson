We evaluate roof orientation (south-facing is optimal), pitch, condition, and any shading issues from East Tucson's scenic mountain views or mature landscaping. Using satellite imagery and specialized software, we model sun exposure throughout the year to estimate production."

With TEP electric rates and Arizona's abundant sunshine, a properly sized solar system can reduce your electric bill by 80-100%. Typical East Tucson homeowners save $1,200-$2,400 annually, totaling $30,000-$60,000 over 25 years. The 30% federal tax credit immediately reduces system cost by thousands of dollars, shortening payback periods to 7-10 years."

Solar also provides protection against future TEP rate increases, which have historically averaged 3-5% annually. By generating your own electricity, you lock in predictable energy costs for decades."
