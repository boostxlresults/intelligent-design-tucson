Unlike standard rooter service that punches a hole through clogs, hydro jetting cleans the entire circumference of the pipe, removing grease, scale, roots, and debris. The result is pipes that flow like new and stay clear much longer than conventional drain clearing."

Hydro jetting is safe for most pipe materials when performed by experienced technicians who understand proper pressure settings and techniques. We always camera-inspect pipes before hydro jetting to ensure they're structurally sound enough to withstand the water pressure."

For recurring drain problems, camera inspection often reveals the root cause and allows us to recommend permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes. You receive a copy of the inspection video and a written report explaining our findings."

Grease is particularly problematic—it flows down drains as a liquid when hot, then solidifies as it cools, accumulating on pipe walls and trapping other debris. Over time, this buildup narrows the pipe opening until water can barely flow. Food particles, coffee grounds, and starchy materials add to the problem, creating dense clogs that resist simple plunging."

For severe grease clogs, hydro jetting is often the best solution—the high-pressure water cuts through grease completely and flushes it from the system. We also provide recommendations for preventing future kitchen clogs, such as using drain screens, disposing of grease properly, and running hot water after using the garbage disposal."

Hair is particularly troublesome because it doesn't break down and tends to catch on rough spots inside pipes, creating mats that trap other materials. Bathroom sink pop-up assemblies also collect hair and gunk that restrict drainage."

For shower and tub drains, we often remove the strainer or overflow plate to access the clog directly. Slow bathroom drains caught early are usually simple fixes—waiting until water no longer drains at all makes the job more difficult and expensive."

For clogs beyond the toilet trap, we may need to access the main line through a cleanout or roof vent. If multiple toilets in your home are backing up or flushing slowly, the problem is likely in the main sewer line, requiring rooter service or camera inspection to diagnose and clear."

Roots naturally seek water sources and will infiltrate sewer lines through joints, cracks, or weak points in the pipe material. Once inside, roots grow rapidly in the nutrient-rich environment, eventually filling the pipe and causing complete blockages. Clay and cast iron pipes are particularly vulnerable to root intrusion."

These blades are designed to shear through roots while minimizing damage to the pipe itself. However, root cutting is usually a temporary solution—roots will grow back unless the pipe is repaired or lined. After clearing root clogs, we typically recommend camera inspection to assess pipe condition and discuss long-term solutions like trenchless pipe lining to permanently prevent root intrusion."
