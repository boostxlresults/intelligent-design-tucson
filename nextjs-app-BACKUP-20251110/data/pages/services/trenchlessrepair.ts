These resins are tested and approved for contact with drinking water, resistant to chemicals commonly found in sewer systems, immune to root penetration and corrosion, and capable of withstanding decades of thermal cycling.

The epoxy resin is harder and more durable than the original pipe material, whether cast iron, clay, or concrete. Because the lining is jointless, it eliminates the weak points where traditional pipes typically fail. This is why IPT can offer a 50-year warranty—the lined pipe is simply superior to anything else available."

Using high-pressure water jetting equipment, we remove scale, roots, grease, and debris that could interfere with liner adhesion. For severely root-infested pipes, we may use specialized cutting tools to grind away heavy root masses and open the pipe to full diameter. This cleaning process is crucial—the liner must bond directly to clean pipe walls for maximum strength and longevity."

We insert the liner into your sewer pipe through an access point—usually an existing cleanout or small access pit. Using water or air pressure, we carefully invert the liner so it unfurls inside the pipe, with the resin-saturated side against the pipe walls. The pressure forces the flexible liner to conform perfectly to the interior shape of the pipe, including any bends or irregularities."

We use either hot water circulation or steam to bring the resin to curing temperature (typically 160-180°F), which we maintain for several hours. The heat causes the epoxy to harden, transforming the flexible liner into a rigid, structural pipe. After curing and cooling, we deflate and remove the pressure bladder, trim the liner ends flush with existing pipes, and reinstate any lateral connections (such as cleanouts or branch lines)."

Traditional excavation would require removing and replacing irrigation lines, tree protection measures or removal, reseeding or re-sodding large areas, concrete removal and replacement, decorative rock removal and replacement, and potential structural repairs if excavation compromises building foundations. These restoration costs can range from $5,000-$20,000 or more, depending on property features."

Everything else remains untouched. When you factor in total project costs including restoration, trenchless repair typically costs 30-50% less than traditional excavation. Plus, you avoid weeks of living with a torn-up yard and the stress of supervising multiple contractors for restoration work."
