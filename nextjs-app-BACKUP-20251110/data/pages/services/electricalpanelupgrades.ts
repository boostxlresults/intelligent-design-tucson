As modern homes use more electricity than ever—with air conditioning, electric vehicles, home offices, smart home devices, and energy-intensive appliances—older electrical panels often struggle to meet these demands. At Intelligent Design, we specialize in professional electrical panel upgrades that provide the capacity, safety features, and reliability today's Tucson homes require."

            "content": "Many Tucson homes built before the 1990s have outdated 100-amp or even 60-amp electrical panels that simply can't support modern electrical loads. These older panels lack important safety features like arc fault and ground fault protection, may contain obsolete components like fuses or problematic brands like Federal Pacific, and frequently experience circuit overloads that trip breakers or create fire hazards. Our licensed electricians can assess your current panel and recommend the right upgrade to meet your home's power needs."
