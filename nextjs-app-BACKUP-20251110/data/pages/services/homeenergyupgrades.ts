A properly sized residential solar system can eliminate 70-100% of your electricity bills, providing $1,200-2,400 in annual savings. Combined with federal tax credits (30%), state incentives, and net metering, most systems pay for themselves in 6-9 years while protecting against future rate increases. Solar panels also increase home values by $15,000-30,000 on average."

Combined with proper attic ventilation, this reduces AC runtime and extends equipment life. Attic improvements often provide the best \"bang for the buck\" in hot climates, with costs of $1,500-3,000 typically returning 10-15% annual savings on cooling costs. The cooler attic also protects stored items and roof shingles."
