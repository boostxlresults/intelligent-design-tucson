            <p>In 2002, after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps as Presidential security at HMX-1 in Quantico, VA., Andrew Dobbins left the Corps and entered the world of air conditioning and heating. Right from the beginning, he brought a different approach to his work. This was the attitude needed to make Intelligent Design the Best Solar, Plumbing, & HVAC Company in Tucson. During his time in the Corps, Andrew had developed a great appreciation for attention to detail. He also understood the importance of processes.</p>
            <p>This was to benefit him as he excelled in the fields of product differentiation, heat load engineering, system customization, system design and estimation. Over the next several years, Andrew became adept in all aspects of residential system design. He also received a number of certifications, including EPA certification, Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification (Building Analyst and AC/Heat Pump), heat load certification. Finally, Andrew attained his Arizona Registrar of Contractors CR39 residential and commercial HVAC license.</p>
            <p>He was ready for the next step in his life. In 2009, Andrew decided to go into business for himself. He had seen the way things ought to be done, and he had compared it to the way most companies did business. He realized that this was the only way that customers could get the quality and integrity they deserve from the Best Solar, Plumbing, & HVAC Company in Tucson. Starting with three staff members and working out of a home garage, Andrew went all in, selling his truck for $20,000 for capital to start his own company. That was the beginning of our story—but far from the end!</p>
