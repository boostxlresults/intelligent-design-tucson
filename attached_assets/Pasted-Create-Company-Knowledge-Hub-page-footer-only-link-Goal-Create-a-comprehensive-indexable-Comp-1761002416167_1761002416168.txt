Create “Company Knowledge Hub” page (footer-only link)

Goal:
Create a comprehensive, indexable Company Knowledge Hub page at
/about-intelligent-design for Intelligent Design Air Conditioning, Plumbing, Roofing, Solar & Electric (Tucson, AZ).
Use Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind (existing project).
Add JSON-LD schema for Organization, LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, and BreadcrumbList.
Important: The page must be public, indexable, in sitemap, and only linked in the footer (no header nav link).

1) Create file: app/about-intelligent-design/page.tsx

Build a long-form, scannable page (~1,800–2,400 words) with jump links, headings, and internal links to services.

Include Tucson-centric content, company history, certifications, awards, trust signals (22,000+ 5-star reviews, BBB A+), and service area.

Use a Hero with a concise title + subheadline, but keep it informational (not salesy).

Import a <Schema/> component (we’ll create next) to inject JSON-LD blocks.

Ensure export const metadata is present with SEO title/description/open graph.

Create the full file with this exact content:

// app/about-intelligent-design/page.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Schema } from "../_components/Schema"; // We will create this file next
import { cn } from "../_lib/utils"; // If you don't have a cn helper, replace cn(...) with string joins
import { Separator } from "@/components/ui/separator";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "About Intelligent Design | Company Knowledge Hub – Tucson’s Highest-Rated Home Services",

If your project doesn’t have a cn helper or Separator, remove those imports/usages or replace with simple HTML.

3) Update the footer to include the ONLY link to this page

Do NOT add this page to the header or top navigation.

Add a single, clear link in the Footer. If you already have a footer, replace or update it. If not, create one.

Edit file: app/_components/Footer.tsx (replace content)

// app/_components/Footer.tsx
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className="border-t mt-16">
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 py-10 grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 text-sm">
        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold">Intelligent Design</h4>
          <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
            Family-owned, veteran-owned, and locally trusted since 1979.
          </p>
          <address className="mt-3 not-italic text-muted-foreground">

            <a className="underline" href="tel:+15206223205">(520) 622-3205</a>
          </address>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold">Services</h4>
          <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><Link className="underline" href="/air-conditioning">HVAC</Link></li>

            <li><Link className="underline" href="/solar">Solar Monitoring</Link></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 className="font-semibold">Company</h4>
          <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><Link className="underline" href="/about">About Us</Link></li>
            {/* IMPORTANT: Knowledge Hub link lives ONLY in the footer */}
            <li>
              <Link className="underline" href="/about-intelligent-design">
                Company Knowledge Hub

            <li><Link className="underline" href="/careers">Careers</Link></li>

        <div>

          <span>© {new Date().getFullYear()} Intelligent Design. All rights reserved.</span>
          <span>Tucson’s Highest-Rated HVAC, Plumbing, Roofing & Electrical Experts</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
}


If your project uses a different path for Footer (e.g., app/_components/Footer.tsx already exists), update that file in place.
Ensure your app/layout.tsx imports and renders <Footer /> at the bottom of <body>.

4) Ensure app/layout.tsx renders the Footer and stays indexable

Open app/layout.tsx and verify:

<Footer /> is imported and rendered.

No noindex meta tags are present globally.

GTM + ServiceTitan DNI (if present) remain intact.

If you need a reference layout, here’s a minimal safe pattern (replace only if needed):

// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import "./_styles/globals.css";
import Footer from "./_components/Footer";
import GTM from "./_components/GTM"; // if you created this earlier
import DNIInjector from "./_components/DNIInjector"; // if present

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL("https://www.idesignac.com"),
  title: {
    default: "Intelligent Design – Tucson’s Highest-Rated Home Services",
    template: "Intelligent Design | %s",
  },
  robots: { index: true, follow: true },
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>{/* other head tags */}</head>
      <body className="min-h-screen antialiased">
        {/* Keep GTM & DNI as you’ve set them up */}
        {typeof window !== "undefined" ? <GTM /> : null}
        {typeof window !== "undefined" ? <DNIInjector /> : null}
        {children}
        <Footer />
        {/* GTM noscript fallback can be placed here if using noscript iframe */}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

5) Make sure it’s in the sitemap

If you’re using next-sitemap, it will auto-include pages under /app. If you have exclusions configured, do not exclude /about-intelligent-design.
Double-check next-sitemap.config.js to ensure default inclusion.

6) Strict requirements recap

The Company Knowledge Hub lives at /about-intelligent-design.

It is public, indexable, internally linked only in the Footer (no header nav link).

It includes thorough, Tucson-centric content and JSON-LD for Organization, LocalBusiness, Service, FAQPage, and BreadcrumbList via <Schema />.

It is present in sitemap.xml and helps establish our brand entity for AI models.

Please generate these files exactly as provided and confirm the page builds without TypeScript errors.
Do not prompt for clarification — implement as specified.
