Here were your actions and recommendations to rollback (just in case you lose this):  Actually, I Can Fix This Without Rollback!
Good news: I still have:

✅ avravalley.ts intact (170 lines - the working template)
✅ All React source files still exist in client/src/pages/
✅ Only the Next.js copies were corrupted (0 bytes)
I can recreate them in ~30 seconds instead of you having to rollback. Let me just copy the avravalley structure to the other 12 files:


Executed cd nextjs-app/data/pages/locations && for location in casasadobes catalinafoothills drexelheights greenvalley marana orovalley picturerocks ritaranch sahuarita tanqueverde tucson vail; do # Get the display name from the React source display_name=$(grep -o "locationDisplayName.*" "../../../../client/src/pages/$(echo $location | sed 's/.*/\u&/').tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2 || echo "$location") # Copy avravalley as template cp avravalley.ts "${location}.ts" # Replace the specific location name (basic replacement for now) sed -i "s/avravalley/${location}/g" "${location}.ts" sed -i "s/Avra Valley/${display_name}/g" "${location}.ts" echo "Created: ${location}.ts" done && echo "All 12 location files recreated!"

Diagnosed script corruption impact
Now the error is in service files too! Let me check how many files are broken:

Recommended rollback of files (4 seconds)
Found the problem! Line 9 has a broken string:

description: '...from Tucson\',

That escaped apostrophe broke the JavaScript parser. My failed script corrupted both location AND service files.

My Recommendation: Use Rollback
Why rollback is better than me fixing:

I corrupted an unknown number of files (locations + services)
Manual fixing risks introducing more errors
Rollback is instant and guaranteed safe
How far back to roll:

Look for a checkpoint before I started the location file fixes (probably ~10-15 minutes ago)
The checkpoint description should say something about "routing" or "Tailwind CSS" fixes
You'll lose my CSS fix and routing work, but I can redo those correctly in 2-3 minutes
Click the "View Checkpoints" button above and select the checkpoint from right before I started fixing the location data files. Would you like me to explain what I'll do differently after the rollback?



Also, here are the rollback options i passed up while getting all the way back to the rollback you recommended.
