Checklist Add-On: Q&A Deprecation + AI FAQ Expansion Strategy

Goal: Future-proof Intelligent Design’s local and AI search visibility by leveraging past Q&A history and expanding it into a fully AI-citable FAQ + blog silo strategy.

✅ Step 1: Repurpose Existing Google Q&A Data

Export existing GBP Q&A before November 3, 2025

Preserve and tag Q&As by topic (HVAC, Plumbing, Solar, Roofing, etc.)

Repurpose into:

On-site FAQ sections with FAQPage schema

Short-form blog posts answering each Q&A in depth

Local landing page micro-FAQs (e.g., “Is Sahuarita covered for 24/7 plumbing?”)

Customer email and social content FAQs

✅ Step 2: Expand AI-Optimized Q&A Blog Library

Build a content series using AI FAQ prompts such as:

“How long should I wait before turning on my AC after install?”

“Do you offer drain cleaning at flat rates?”

“Do you help with the solar 30% tax credit paperwork?”

Add internal links from each blog to its service silo (e.g., Solar → 30% Tax Credit Blog)

Assign each post a structured schema block to increase AI visibility

✅ Step 3: Geo-Relevant & Intent-Driven Content Structure

Develop Q&A-based content around geo-specific variations:

“Is HVAC same-day service available in Marana?”

“Do you offer trenchless pipe repair in Vail?”

Use these as FAQ items on each local landing page and as standalone blogs to train LLMs

✅ Step 4: Schema + Tagging for AI/LLM Citations

Apply FAQPage, LocalBusiness, and Service schema to each repurposed FAQ

Tag posts with: ai-visible, ask-maps, geo-modified, and service category

Track citationability (future phase): monitor how often blogs are picked up by Gemini, SGE, or Perplexity

Summary Instruction for Replit Prompt:

Please add these benchmarks to the pre-launch checklist and content strategy phase:

“Build an AI-optimized FAQ + Q&A content library based on exported GBP Q&As and expanded questions sourced from owner knowledge, reviews, and customer service logs. Each question should be converted into a structured FAQ and optionally a blog. All content must follow schema guidelines and be integrated into the appropriate silo (HVAC, Plumbing, etc.), and tagged for future AI monitoring and LLM readiness.”
