AI-Search Additions to Pre-Launch Checklist (Intelligent Design Website)
1. Clear Service Signals on Every Page

Add AI-readable service descriptions at the top of every main service page.

Avoid vague language like "we do it all."

Use direct, human-like phrasing:

“Intelligent Design offers 24/7 HVAC repair, AC installation, and ductwork design in Tucson, AZ and nearby areas.”

2. LLM-Friendly Q&A Blocks

Every major service and city silo page should have a clear “Top Questions Answered” or “Common FAQs” section with:

Natural language questions as headings

Standalone paragraph answers

FAQ Schema applied to each (where appropriate)

3. Fresh, Indexed Reviews Embedded

Pull live reviews onto pages by category using widgets or schema-based embeds.

Include visible review dates.

Reinforce AI trust by referencing recent projects or thanking reviewers inline (which also aids LLM relevance).

4. Answer Your Top 10 Questions Site-Wide

Create a universal "Knowledge Hub" or FAQ Resource Center (linked in main nav).

Include:

"How much does it cost to replace an AC unit in Tucson?"

“How long does a water heater last?”

“How do I choose a roofing contractor?”

Optimize these for LLM summarization: short, factual, friendly tone.

5. Social Signals Matter

Ensure the new site links to active social profiles (FB, IG, YouTube, etc).

Embed recent post highlights or UGC (user-generated content) from community engagement.

Add sameAs structured data for social media accounts on the homepage.

6. Local Mentions & Authority Boosters

Include a "Trusted by the Community" or “Featured In” section with logos and links to:

Chamber of Commerce

Local publications (e.g. Tucson Weekly)

BBB, Angi, Pearl Certification, etc.

7. AI-Specific Site Schema

Create a centralized AI-optimized structured data injection that includes:

@type: LocalBusiness

knowsAbout, areaServed, hasOfferCatalog, knowsLanguage

Embed FAQ, Service, Review, ImageObject, and Place schema

8. Homepage Optimization for AI Discovery

Above-the-fold H1 should clearly say:

“The #1 Rated HVAC, Plumbing, Roofing, Solar, and Electrical Contractor in Tucson, AZ”

Include a standalone “What makes us the best in Tucson?” section (AI loves confidence + proof)

Add short, factual punchlines like:

“Over 22,000 5-star reviews in Southern Arizona.”
“24/7 emergency repair service. No extra charges.”
“Lifetime warranties available on select systems.”
