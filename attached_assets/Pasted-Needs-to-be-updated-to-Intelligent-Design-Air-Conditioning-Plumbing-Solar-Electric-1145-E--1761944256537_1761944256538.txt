remove - Consider roof age in your decision. A 5-year-old tile roof with storm damage should almost always be repaired—it has decades of remaining service life and repair preserves that value. A 25-year-old shingle roof with multiple leak areas should likely be replaced—it's approaching the end of expected service life and repairs are just delaying the inevitable. We consider percentage of damaged area: damage affecting less than 20% of roof area usually warrants repair, while damage exceeding 40% often makes replacement more economical.

Update - Repair if: roof is under 15 years old, damage is localized (under 30% of roof surface), underlying structure is sound, cost is under 30% of replacement cost, and no recurring leak patterns exist. Replace if: roof is 20+ years old, damage exceeds 30% of surface area, multiple leak areas exist, underlayment is deteriorated, frequent repairs are needed, energy costs are high from poor insulation, or repair costs exceed 40% of replacement cost.

Every roof is different with construction type, quality, and materials.  Therefore, having an experienced roofing expert give a detailed assessment is always recommended. Here are some typical guidelines:  If damage is localized (under 30% of roof surface), underlying structure is sound, cost is under 30% of replacement cost, and no recurring leak patterns exist, then repair is plausible. If roof damage exceeds 30% of surface area, multiple leak areas exist, underlayment is deteriorated, frequent repairs are needed, energy costs are high from poor insulation, or repair costs exceed 40% of replacement cost, replacement may be the best way forward. We provide accurate assessments and help you make the most economical decision for your Tucson home.

Update - Yes! We maintain extensive inventories of clay and concrete roof tiles to match existing Tucson residential roofs. For standard colors and styles (terra cotta, mission, S-tile, flat tile), we typically have perfect matches in stock. For discontinued or custom colors, we work with specialty suppliers or can have tiles custom-colored to match. When exact matches are unavailable, we strategically place replacement tiles in less visible areas and can blend tiles across sections for uniform appearance.

When exact matches are unavailable, we strategically place replacement tiles in less visible areas and can blend tiles across sections for uniform appearance. In the case where we can match the exact original color and style, there may be a slight difference of colors because your original tiles have been exposed to heavy sunlight and weather exposure.



Rewrite to only include info that states that insurance will only cover damage from wind and hail.  Otherwise known as acts of God.

Insurance typically covers roof damage from covered perils: wind damage from monsoon storms, hail damage, fallen trees or debris, fire damage, and certain types of water damage. Insurance usually does NOT cover: normal wear and tear, deterioration from age or lack of maintenance, cosmetic damage not affecting function, or pre-existing conditions. We provide detailed documentation, photos, and estimates for insurance claims, work directly with adjusters, and help navigate the claims process to maximize your coverage.


Update - Properly executed roof repairs should last: tile replacements 20-30+ years (matching the surrounding roof's remaining life), shingle repairs 10-15 years, flashing repairs 15-25 years, underlayment patches 15-20 years, and flat roof membrane repairs 10-20 years. Repair longevity depends on quality of materials used, proper installation technique, and ongoing maintenance. Tucson's extreme UV exposure and thermal cycling can reduce repair lifespan compared to other climates, making professional installation critical for lasting results.
