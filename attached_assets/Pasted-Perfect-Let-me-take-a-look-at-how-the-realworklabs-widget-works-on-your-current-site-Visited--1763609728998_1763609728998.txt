Pondered widget content ambiguity (4 seconds)
Excellent! Thanks for the heads up about the realworklabs widget. From what you've described, it sounds like a powerful social proof tool that:

📊 realworklabs Widget Overview
What it does:

Matches Google reviews with actual ServiceTitan job records
Displays real customer reviews alongside job details
Shows zip codes for location credibility
Provides service descriptions/context
SEO & Conversion Value:

Fresh Content: Real-time updates from recent jobs
Local Proof: Zip codes show service coverage
Review Authenticity: Reviews tied to actual jobs (not just generic testimonials)
Trust Signal: ServiceTitan integration proves legitimate business operations
User-Generated Content: Google reviews = fresh, authentic content
🎯 Suggested Pages for Implementation
Based on your site architecture, here are the best candidates:

High-Impact Pages:
Homepage - Primary social proof, highest traffic
Services Overview Page - Show variety of completed jobs
Recent Projects Page - Dedicated showcase (like current site)
Strategic Service Pages:
Main Service Pages (AC Repair Tucson, Plumbing Tucson, etc.) - Filter widget to show only relevant service reviews
High-Traffic Location Pages (Oro Valley, Tucson, Marana) - Filter by zip code to show local social proof
🔧 Technical Integration Notes
When you're ready to implement, I'll need:

Script source URL - The realworklabs embed script
API key/account ID - If widget requires authentication
Configuration options - Filtering by service type, zip code, date range
Display preferences - Number of reviews, layout style, refresh interval
Implementation approach:

Add script to <head> or load dynamically via component
Create a <RealWorkLabsWidget> React component for reusability
Pass props for filtering (service type, location, limit)
Ensure proper loading states and fallbacks
Add to GTM for conversion tracking (widget views/interactions)
💡 Advanced Use Cases
Service-Specific Filtering:

// Show only HVAC reviews on HVAC pages
<RealWorkLabsWidget serviceType="hvac" limit={10} />
// Show only Oro Valley jobs on Oro Valley page
<RealWorkLabsWidget zipCode="85737" limit={8} />

SEO Enhancement:

Widget content should be crawlable (not just iframe)
Each review could have Review schema markup
Could improve "freshness" signals for Google
