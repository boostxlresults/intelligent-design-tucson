Their home features large picture windows showcasing stunning mountain views, but those windows created significant heat gain during summer months. Running dual-zone air conditioning systems nearly constantly from May through October resulted in electric bills routinely exceeding $420 monthly during peak summer. With both parents working from home and three teenagers consuming electricity for computers, gaming systems, and charging multiple devices, their annual electricity consumption topped 24,000 kWh, costing over $3,800 annually."

They wanted a solar solution that would dramatically reduce electric costs while providing backup power capability during grid outages. The home's metal roof had excellent south and west exposure with no shading from vegetation, making it ideal for solar installation. After researching multiple solar providers and attending three in-home consultations, they chose Intelligent Design based on our 22,000+ five-star reviews, transparent pricing, and expertise with solar-plus-storage systems.

We created a critical loads subpanel to manage essential circuits during outages: well pump, kitchen refrigerator, internet/networking equipment, master bedroom AC zone, select lighting, and security systems. This configuration allows the Andersons to maintain normal operations indefinitely during extended outages as long as solar recharges batteries daily. Installation required three full days. Day one involved electrical infrastructure: upgrading the main panel to 200-amp service, installing the critical loads subpanel with eight dedicated circuits, and running new conduit. Day two focused on solar array installation across three roof planes. Day three completed Tesla Powerwall installation in their garage, inverter configuration, system integration, commissioning, and homeowner training."

Intelligent Design designed a comprehensive system that solved both problems. The installation team was incredibly professional. They protected our property, worked efficiently, and cleaned up perfectly. Our monitoring app is fascinating - we watch our panels generate 80+ kWh on sunny summer days, completely covering our consumption and charging our batteries. We've gone through four monsoon outages since installation, and each time, the batteries kicked in seamlessly. Our neighbors lose power while we operate normally. We don't even notice outages anymore. Our electric bill dropped from $420+ to just the $15 TEP connection fee. We're saving over $4,000 annually, and with TEP rate increases, our savings grow every year. The system exceeded production estimates by 7% in the first year. We're on track for complete payback in just 9.5 years, then decades of free electricity plus backup power security. We've referred four neighbors to Intelligent Design, and three have already installed solar. Best investment we've made in our home. The peace of mind during monsoon season alone is worth it.\" - Susan Anderson, Picture Rocks"

Inspect your roof for obvious damage: missing or cracked shingles, visible sagging, water stains on interior ceilings, or granule loss on asphalt shingles. If your roof is approaching 15-20 years old (the typical lifespan of composition shingles in Arizona's intense sun), consider replacing it before solar installation. Installing solar on an aging roof means you'll need to remove and reinstall panels when you eventually replace the roof, adding $3,000-5,000 in additional costs."

Note which directions different roof planes face - south-facing roofs in Picture Rocks produce optimal solar energy, while west-facing planes generate strong afternoon production. East-facing roofs produce well in morning but less in afternoon. North-facing roofs in the Northern Hemisphere receive minimal direct sun and are rarely suitable for solar panels.

Picture Rocks' natural desert landscape typically has fewer mature trees than urban areas, but mesquite, palo verde, or imported shade trees may cast shadows.

Trimming costs $300-800 for most residential trees and immediately improves solar production potential. Our solar designers can model production impacts with and without tree trimming so you can make informed decisions. Modern microinverter systems minimize shading impacts by allowing each panel to operate independently rather than having one shaded panel drag down an entire string's performance. However, eliminating shading still provides best results. Factor tree trimming costs into your overall solar budget. Remember that trees continue growing, so plan for periodic maintenance trimming every 3-5 years to maintain optimal solar access."

Spring's moderate temperatures mean panels produce closer to rated capacity. Clear skies and strong sun angles combine to generate maximum kilowatt-hours.

HOAs can impose \"reasonable\" restrictions that don't significantly increase system costs or decrease energy production by more than 10%. Common reasonable restrictions include requiring all-black panels instead of blue-framed panels, specifying rear-facing roof placement when possible, or requiring landscape screening for ground-mount systems. Unreasonable restrictions include requiring specific (expensive) panel brands, prohibiting south-facing placement (optimal orientation), or requiring equipment placement that reduces production >10%."

We've successfully navigated dozens of HOA approvals and understand common concerns and compliant solutions. Our design team can often position panels to meet HOA aesthetic requirements while maintaining optimal production. We prepare comprehensive HOA applications including architectural renderings, equipment specifications, and compliance documentation. Early HOA engagement prevents delays and ensures smooth project approval. Understanding your solar rights under Arizona law helps you advocate effectively while maintaining good community relations."
