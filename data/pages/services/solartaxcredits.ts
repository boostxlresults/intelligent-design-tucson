This is not a tax deduction that merely reduces taxable income—it's a direct credit reducing your actual tax liability. For a typical $22,000 solar installation, the ITC delivers $6,600 in federal tax credits, reducing your net cost to $15,400. Combined with Arizona state incentives including property tax exemptions and sales tax exemptions, total incentives typically reduce solar costs by 35-42%."

Batteries provide backup power during outages and allow peak-shaving (storing daytime solar for evening use, avoiding high time-of-use rates). Analysis: Battery economics depend on your priorities. For backup power value, batteries pay for themselves through avoided spoilage, safety, and comfort during Tucson's monsoon season outages (average 2-4 outages annually for most neighborhoods).

This is one of the most common and costly mistakes. Approximately 15-20% of solar customers nationally use leases or PPAs without understanding they forfeit tax credits worth thousands of dollars.
