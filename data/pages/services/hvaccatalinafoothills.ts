        answer: "We provide comprehensive HVAC services including AC installation and replacement, heating system installation and repair, ductless mini-split systems, preventive maintenance plans, emergency repair service, duct cleaning and sealing, indoor air quality systems, smart thermostat installation, multi-zone climate control, and energy efficiency upgrades.

Our service vehicles are fully stocked with parts for high-efficiency systems common in Catalina Foothills luxury homes.

      },
      {
        question: "What size AC system does my Catalina Foothills home need?",
        answer: "Proper AC sizing requires professional Manual J load calculations accounting for your home's square footage, insulation, windows, sun exposure, ceiling heights, and Catalina Foothills' elevation. Most Catalina Foothills homes need 3-6 ton systems, with larger luxury homes often requiring multiple systems or zoning. Oversized systems cycle frequently and don't dehumidify properly, while undersized systems can't maintain comfort during peak summer heat. We provide free in-home assessments to determine the right size for your specific home."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I repair or replace my aging HVAC system in Catalina Foothills?",
        answer: "Generally, if your system is over 12-15 years old and repair costs exceed 50% of replacement value, replacement makes more financial sense. Other replacement indicators include declining efficiency with rising energy bills, frequent breakdowns and service calls, inconsistent temperatures throughout your home, and systems using R-22 refrigerant (no longer manufactured). New high-efficiency systems (16-22 SEER) can reduce cooling costs by 30-50% compared to older 10-12 SEER units, often paying for themselves in 8-12 years through energy savings."
