They loved the home's location and mountain views but quickly discovered electrical limitations. The home had an outdated 100-amp electrical panel with an old Federal Pacific panel (a known fire hazard), no capacity for the Tesla Model Y they had on order, frequent circuit breaker trips when running the AC and pool equipment simultaneously, no GFCI or AFCI protection on most circuits, and insufficient outdoor outlets for their planned landscape lighting and entertaining area."

        "content": "Our Solution: After a comprehensive electrical assessment including thermal imaging of the existing panel revealing several hot spots and unsafe connections, load calculations for current and planned electrical usage, and evaluation of the service entrance and meter, we recommended a complete electrical service upgrade: replacement of the hazardous 100-amp Federal Pacific panel with a modern 200-amp panel with 40 circuit spaces, service entrance upgrade coordinated with Tucson Electric Power, installation of AFCI breakers for all bedrooms and living areas per current code, GFCI protection for kitchen, bathrooms, garage, and all outdoor circuits, dedicated 60-amp circuit and Tesla Wall Connector installation in the garage, surge protection for the entire home, and installation of 6 additional outdoor weatherproof outlets for landscape lighting and entertaining."

The electrical upgrade cost $8,400 including the EV charger installation, and the family received a $1,000 federal tax credit for the EV charger portion. They reported complete peace of mind and recommended our services to three neighbors who subsequently upgraded their electrical systems."
