When monsoon storms knocked out power for 10 hours last July, our neighbors scrambled for generators while we operated normally. The batteries kicked in instantly - we didn't even lose our internet connections. Our clients never knew we'd lost grid power. Beyond backup capability, we're saving $285+ monthly on electricity. The system produces surplus energy most months, building credits that offset winter consumption. The Tesla app shows real-time production, consumption, and battery status. It's fascinating watching our home become energy independent. During recent heat emergency grid alerts, we actually provided power back to the grid from our batteries, helping the community while earning premium credits. The investment was substantial, but our business continuity and monthly savings make it worthwhile. We've calculated complete payback in 10 years with 15+ years of additional free electricity and backup protection. The peace of mind is priceless.

Walk around your Cortaro home and inspect for visible damage: missing shingles, cracks, water stains on ceilings, sagging sections, or significant granule loss on asphalt shingles. If your roof is approaching 15-20 years old (typical asphalt shingle lifespan in Tucson's UV environment), consider replacement before solar. Removing and reinstalling panels to replace a roof costs $3,000-$5,000, so addressing roof issues proactively saves money long-term."

Cortaro's tile and metal roofs generally last 40-50+ years and make excellent solar platforms.

Qualifying expenses include all solar equipment, installation labor, permits, electrical panel upgrades, and battery storage installed with solar. The credit is claimed for the tax year when installation completes and the system activates. Phase-down: 30% through 2032, reducing to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, then expiring for residential systems. TEP net metering provides full retail-rate credits (13.2 cents/kWh average) for excess production with no monthly fees, annual true-up, and grandfathered rates locked for system lifetime. TEP programs include Home Performance rebates ($150-$300 for insulation, $100-$200 for air sealing, $200-$400 for high-efficiency HVAC) and potential battery storage rebates ($400-$600 per kWh, subject to availability).

            "type": "paragraph",
            "content": "Cortaro's exceptional solar resource provides consistent year-round production with seasonal variations based on daylight hours and sun angle. Summer (May-August): Peak production delivers 120-140% of annual monthly average. A 7 kW system produces 1,050-1,225 kWh monthly with 12-13 productive hours daily. Panel temperatures reach 165-180 degrees reducing efficiency 15-18%, but extreme sun compensates. Monsoon storms (July-August) reduce production 10-15% but naturally clean panels. Surplus production banks net metering credits for winter. Spring/Fall (March-April, September-October): Ideal conditions deliver 95-110% of monthly average (830-965 kWh for 7 kW). Cooler panel temperatures (120-140 degrees) optimize efficiency with reduced thermal losses (8-12% vs. 15-18% in summer). Moderate consumption maximizes net metering credit accumulation. Winter (November-February): Reduced production delivers 65-80% of monthly average (570-700 kWh for 7 kW) due to shorter 8-9 hour days and lower sun angles. However, cooler panel temperatures (100-120 degrees) deliver peak efficiency (just 5-8% thermal loss). Most days remain clear despite occasional 2-4 cloudy days monthly. Minimal air conditioning consumption means reduced production still covers high percentages of usage. Banked summer credits offset winter shortfalls."

            "content": "Solar panels require minimal maintenance with no moving parts. Cortaro's desert conditions warrant panel cleaning 2-3 times yearly (October after monsoon, March before summer peak, July mid-monsoon) improving production 3-8%. Use standard garden hose in early morning or evening avoiding thermal shock. Trim trees semi-annually ensuring no shade 9am-3pm. Monitor weekly via smartphone app for sudden production drops exceeding 20%. Professional inspections every 3-5 years ($145-$195) verify connections, inverter operation, panel condition, and racking integrity. Environmental Benefits: The average 7.5 kW Cortaro system eliminates 8.5-9.5 tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to planting 220+ trees, removing 2 cars from roads, or avoiding 22,000 miles of driving. Over 25 years: 210-240 tons of CO2 prevented, comparable to preserving 12+ acres of forest. Your panels replace fossil fuel electricity, directly reducing air pollution (nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter). Water conservation: Power plants require 600-800 gallons per megawatt-hour for cooling. Your 11,250 kWh annual production saves 6,750-9,000 gallons yearly, totaling 170,000-225,000 gallons over 25 years. Many Cortaro families choose solar for environmental values, leaving cleaner air for children and demonstrating community leadership in renewable energy adoption."

            "content": "Most Cortaro solar installations operate without battery storage, relying on TEP's excellent net metering as a free virtual battery. However, some homeowners add batteries for backup power during outages or increased energy independence. Battery basics: Store excess daytime solar production for evening use or power outages, provide backup when grid fails (standard solar shuts down during outages for safety), enable time-of-use optimization, increase utility independence. Leading options: Tesla Powerwall 2 (13.5 kWh, proven reliability, integrated inverter), Enphase IQ Battery (modular 3.36-10.08 kWh, scalable), LG RESU (9.8-16 kWh, excellent warranty), Generac PWRcell (9-18 kWh modular, American-made). Configurations: Essential loads backup (10-13 kWh) powers refrigerator, lights, internet, garage door, adequate for critical needs. Partial home backup (17-20 kWh) adds AC for 1-2 rooms, outlets, washer/dryer. Whole-home backup (27-40+ kWh) powers entire home, requires multiple batteries and substantial investment. Economics: Batteries rarely pay for themselves through energy arbitrage in TEP territory due to excellent net metering. Costs: $10,000-$15,000 (small) to $25,000-$45,000+ (whole-home), with 30% federal tax credit. When they make sense: Frequent outages, critical medical equipment, home business, or energy independence priority. When they don't: Rare outages, no critical power needs, existing generator, or prioritizing maximum ROI. Our recommendation: Most should install solar without batteries initially, adding later if circumstances change."

            "content": "Insurance: Solar installations ($15,000-$30,000+) require proper protection. Most homeowners policies automatically cover solar as permanent improvements, protecting against fire, wind (monsoon storms), hail, lightning, falling trees, vandalism, theft. Coverage typically at replacement cost up to dwelling limit. Premium increases: $50-$150 annually. Key points: Notify insurer when adding solar (failure could deny claims), document system with photos and specifications, verify coverage limits, understand deductibles apply ($1,000-$2,500 typical). Our liability insurance covers installation damage. Manufacturer warranties cover defects; your insurance covers external damage. Property taxes: Arizona provides substantial tax benefits. Residential solar in Pima County receives 100% property tax exemption for added value under A.R.S. 42-11054. Solar adding $20,000 to home value generates zero additional property taxes. Exemption continues indefinitely for 25-30+ year system lifespan, providing cumulative savings of $3,000-$5,000+ at current rates (approximately 1% of assessed value). Combined with 30% federal credit, net metering, electric bill savings, and home value increases, Arizona's property tax exemption makes Cortaro one of the nation's most financially attractive solar markets."
