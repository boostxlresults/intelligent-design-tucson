Thermal cameras detect temperature differences across roof surfaces caused by wet insulation retaining heat differently than dry insulation, creating thermal signatures identifying moisture locations and extent. Thermography surveys must be conducted during specific conditions maximizing temperature differentials: typically performed in evening hours 2-4 hours after sunset when wet areas retain heat longer than dry areas, requiring minimum 10-15°F temperature differentials between wet and dry insulation for accurate detection, and works optimally on clear nights allowing roof surfaces to cool uniformly. We systematically scan the entire roof surface creating thermal maps showing temperature variations across all areas. Survey results are documented with thermal images overlaid on roof diagrams showing exact moisture locations, quantified moisture severity based on temperature differentials, and estimated wet insulation area requiring attention. Thermography findings guide targeted nuclear moisture meter testing providing precise moisture content readings confirming thermal survey results. This advanced diagnostic capability identifies problems before visible damage occurs, prevents unnecessary roof replacement when localized repairs suffice, targets repair areas precisely minimizing disruption and cost, and supports insurance claims with scientific documentation of moisture intrusion. We recommend thermography for roofs over 10 years old, when interior leak evidence doesn't correlate with visible exterior damage, before [link:/services/commercial-roof-coating|roof coating] or recovery installations, and as part of pre-purchase property assessments.",

With building management authorization, we access interior spaces below roof areas conducting systematic ceiling inspection for water staining, discoloration, or damage indicating current or historical leaks, sagging ceiling tiles or materials suggesting water accumulation, visible mold growth or biological staining, and peeling paint or wall damage near roof connections. We trace visible leak patterns identifying entry points and travel paths water follows from roof penetration to visible damage—often traveling significant distances from actual membrane failure location. We inspect mechanical rooms and equipment areas for roof-mounted equipment penetration leaks, condensation issues from HVAC systems, or drainage problems. We evaluate attic or plenum spaces where accessible for insulation moisture, structural damage, or ventilation issues contributing to roof problems. We document correlation between interior damage and exterior roof conditions identified during visual assessment, helping confirm leak sources and prioritize repairs. Interior assessment is particularly critical for occupied buildings where tenant impacts must be documented, multi-story structures where leak paths are complex, and buildings with valuable equipment or inventory at risk.

Critically, we distinguished fresh storm damage from pre-existing age-related deterioration—essential for insurance claim approval. We implemented immediate protective measures tarping exposed areas before next storm, sealing critical leak points, and protecting damaged tenant spaces.",

For typical commercial buildings, this service life extension delivers enormous value: $150,000 roof expected to last 20 years without inspection-based maintenance actually reaches 25-26 years with preventive care—deferring $150,000 replacement cost 5-6 years creates present value savings of $35,000-$50,000 (assuming 8% discount rate), far exceeding total inspection costs of $8,000-$12,000 over the extended period. Property managers maintaining multi-building portfolios on inspection programs report actual roof service lives consistently exceeding manufacturer estimates by 25-40%, translating to millions in deferred capital expenditures across building portfolios. The strategic timing advantage alone—replacing roofs proactively during budget availability rather than reactively during emergencies—often saves 15-25% through competitive bidding and optimal scheduling versus emergency conditions."

            "content": "Built-Up Roofing (BUR) Systems: Traditional built-up roofing with multiple felt layers and hot-applied asphalt remains on many older Tucson commercial buildings. BUR inspection evaluates gravel surfacing coverage and displacement—bare spots expose underlying felts to UV damage, membrane integrity checking for splits, cracks, or separation between plies, blister formation indicating moisture infiltration or poor installation, and overall material condition assessing remaining service life. We identify ponding water areas where standing water accelerates BUR deterioration, examine edge metal and flashing conditions at all terminations, assess drain and scupper conditions critical for BUR performance, and evaluate whether repair or replacement represents the best economic decision. BUR systems can last 15-25 years with proper maintenance, but Tucson's UV exposure and thermal cycling accelerate aging requiring regular professional assessment ensuring optimal timing for maintenance versus replacement decisions."

            "content": "Metal Roofing Systems: Commercial metal roofing including standing seam, corrugated panels, and structural metal deck systems require specialized inspection expertise. Metal roof assessment examines panel attachment and clip systems checking for loosening from thermal movement, seam integrity and weather-tightness at all panel connections, fastener conditions looking for backing out, corrosion, or failed washers, and coating or finish conditions protecting underlying metal from corrosion. We identify areas where dissimilar metal contact creates galvanic corrosion concerns, evaluate flashing and transition details at penetrations and edges, assess roof pitch adequacy for drainage and snow load if applicable, and examine structural supports and purlins where accessible. Metal roofing systems properly maintained can last 30-50+ years, making professional inspection valuable for identifying maintenance needs preserving this long-term investment and preventing costly premature failures from overlooked minor issues."
