Additionally, they experienced a concerning 18-hour power outage during July 2023 monsoon storm where interior temperatures reached 96°F (dangerous for their vintage wine collection worth $45,000), spoiled $400 in refrigerated foods and medications, couldn't operate security system (leaving property vulnerable), and had no way to cool their home (sweltering night with no sleep).

Intelligent Design's proposal was comprehensive and actually cost less than the panel-only quote from another company. The project was incredibly well-managed—they coordinated everything from gas service to permits to final inspection. Our generator has activated 7 times in the past year, and we barely notice outages now. The power restores in seconds, the wine cellar climate control never interrupts, and we maintain comfortable temperatures regardless of storms. The panel upgrade gave us capacity for the Tesla charger we installed in December and the solar panels going in this spring. The whole-home surge protection already proved its value—neighbors lost electronics in a lightning strike while our systems were fully protected. The wine cellar circuit upgrade also solved an issue where temperature would fluctuate slightly—now it's rock solid. This was a substantial investment but protecting a $45,000 wine collection, maintaining comfort and security during outages, and enabling our planned solar and EV additions made it absolutely worthwhile.
