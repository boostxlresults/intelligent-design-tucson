            "content": "Superior Monsoon Water Management: Pitched roof design excels at rapid water drainage critical during Tucson's violent summer monsoons. Slopes ranging from 4:12 to 6:12 pitch shed water instantly—preventing ponding that plagues flat roofs and causes premature deterioration. During monsoons delivering 2-4 inches of rainfall per hour, pitched roofs channel water to gutters and downspouts without standing water anywhere on the roof surface. This immediate drainage prevents water infiltration through minor defects, reduces stress on roofing materials, eliminates algae and moss growth from moisture retention, and dramatically extends roof system lifespan. Compare this to flat roofs where even properly designed drainage systems leave standing water for hours after storms—creating ongoing moisture exposure accelerating material degradation.\n\nExceptional Natural Ventilation: The angled design of pitched roofs creates ideal conditions for natural convection ventilation—hot air rises and escapes through ridge vents while cooler air enters through soffit vents at lower elevations. This continuous airflow circulation reduces attic temperatures 30-40°F compared to poorly ventilated roofs. In Tucson where unventilated attics reach 160-170°F in summer, proper pitched roof ventilation maintains 120-130°F attic temperatures. This dramatic temperature reduction extends roofing material life 20-30%, lowers cooling costs 15-25% by preventing heat transfer to living spaces, prevents premature shingle aging and tile underlayment deterioration, and eliminates moisture condensation that causes wood rot and mold growth during winter months.\n\nMaterial Versatility and Longevity: Pitched roofs accommodate every roofing material available—from budget-conscious architectural shingles to premium clay tiles and modern metal systems. This flexibility allows you to select optimal materials balancing aesthetics, performance, and budget. Materials properly installed on pitched roofs achieve maximum lifespan: clay tiles 50+ years, concrete tiles 40-50 years, architectural shingles 25-35 years, and metal roofing 40-60 years. The sloped design prevents moisture retention that causes premature degradation common with flat roofing systems.\n\nEnergy Efficiency Optimization: Properly designed pitched roofs with adequate ventilation and insulation dramatically reduce cooling costs in Tucson's climate. The ventilated attic space creates a thermal buffer between extreme roof surface temperatures (often 160-180°F) and interior living spaces. Radiant barriers installed on pitched roof decks reflect 97% of radiant heat, further reducing heat transfer. Cool roofing materials (light-colored tiles, reflective shingles, or metal roofing) installed on pitched roofs combine reflectivity with ventilation for maximum energy savings. Homeowners report cooling cost reductions of 20-40% after pitched roof replacement with optimized ventilation and cool roofing materials—translating to $600-$1,200 annual savings for typical 2,000 sq ft homes."

            "content": "Pitched roof design requires careful consideration of multiple factors specific to Tucson's climate and building requirements. Optimal roof pitch balances water drainage (critical during monsoons delivering 2-4 inches per hour), ventilation effectiveness (essential for managing extreme attic heat), material compatibility (different materials require different minimum pitches), wind resistance (steeper pitches can experience greater wind forces), energy efficiency (pitch affects solar heat gain and ventilation), and aesthetics (pitch dramatically impacts home appearance and style). In Tucson, most residential pitched roofs use 4:12 to 6:12 pitch (4-6 inches vertical rise per 12 inches horizontal run), providing excellent drainage and ventilation while controlling costs."

Summer attic temperatures without adequate ventilation routinely exceed 150-160°F, cooking roofing materials from beneath, dramatically reducing their lifespan, and transferring excessive heat to living spaces below. Proper ventilation—combining intake vents (typically soffit vents) with exhaust vents (ridge vents, gable vents, or powered attic fans)—reduces attic temperatures to 120-130°F, extending roofing material life 20-30%, lowering cooling costs 10-20%, and improving interior comfort.

            "content": "Roof pitch—the slope of your roof measured as vertical rise per horizontal run—significantly impacts performance, cost, aesthetics, and long-term satisfaction. Understanding pitch options helps you make the right choice for your specific situation.\n\nLow Pitch (2:12 to 3:12) - Contemporary Aesthetics: Low-pitch roofs provide clean modern lines ideal for contemporary architectural styles. Benefits include minimal material usage reducing costs 10-15%, lower installation labor (easier access, less safety equipment), simple framing reducing structural costs, and suitability for modern flat-style designs. However, low pitch presents significant limitations for Tucson applications: requires enhanced waterproofing (ice and water shield over entire deck), limits material choices (rules out most tiles, many shingles), provides modest ventilation effectiveness, and may have HOA restrictions in traditional neighborhoods. Low pitch works best for: contemporary homes where aesthetic matches architectural style, covered porches or patio roofs where drainage isn't critical, and small roof sections as part of multi-pitch design. Estimated cost: $6-$10 per square foot installed.\n\nStandard Pitch (4:12 to 6:12) - Optimal for Most Applications: Standard pitch represents the sweet spot for Tucson residential roofing, balancing performance, cost, and aesthetics. This is our most common recommendation. Benefits include excellent monsoon water drainage preventing any ponding, good natural convection ventilation reducing attic heat significantly, compatibility with ALL roofing materials (tile, shingle, metal), balanced construction costs without steep-pitch premiums, suitability for most architectural styles from ranch to Spanish Colonial, easier future maintenance and repairs, and excellent long-term value. Standard pitch accommodates roof-mounted solar panels common in Tucson while maintaining optimal drainage. Estimated cost: $8-$14 per square foot installed depending on materials. This pitch range suits 85% of Tucson residential applications.\n\nSteep Pitch (7:12 to 12:12) - Dramatic Aesthetics & Maximum Performance: Steep-pitch roofs create dramatic architectural statements and provide maximum performance benefits. Advantages include superior water drainage (instant runoff during storms), enhanced natural ventilation through greater height differential, maximum usable attic space for storage or conversion potential, dramatic curb appeal for suitable architectural styles, and excellent for prominent tile roof designs on Spanish/Mediterranean homes. However, steep pitch increases costs 20-40% through more complex framing and structural requirements, additional material usage from increased roof surface area, specialized safety equipment requirements, higher ongoing maintenance costs (professional access required), and potential HOA restrictions on height. Steep pitch makes sense when: architectural style demands dramatic roof presence (Spanish Colonial estates), maximizing attic space for bonus room conversion, properties in Catalina Foothills or similar areas where dramatic profiles enhance value, or custom luxury homes where budget accommodates premium installation costs. Estimated cost: $10-$20+ per square foot installed.\n\nPitch Selection Factors Specific to Tucson: Consider your property's characteristics: homes in historic districts often require specific pitch matching neighborhood character, properties with existing framing may have structural limitations on pitch changes, foothill locations benefit from steeper pitch enhancing drainage, and solar panel plans affect pitch selection (optimal solar angle in Tucson is 32-35 degrees = approximately 7:12 to 8:12 pitch). We evaluate all factors during consultation, providing pitch recommendations optimized for your goals, budget, and property characteristics.

            "content": "Your roofing material selection impacts appearance, longevity, energy efficiency, maintenance requirements, and costs for decades. Each material offers distinct advantages for Tucson's climate.\n\nClay Tile - Premium Longevity & Energy Efficiency: Clay tile represents the gold standard for Tucson pitched roofs. Authentic clay tiles provide unmatched benefits: 50+ year lifespan (often 75-100 years), exceptional heat reflection reducing cooling costs 20-30%, superior fire resistance (Class A rating), wind resistance to 150+ mph when properly installed, timeless beauty enhancing home value $15,000-$40,000, and virtually zero maintenance requirements. Clay's thermal mass absorbs heat slowly during day, releasing it gradually at night, moderating temperature swings. The barrel shape of S-tiles and mission tiles creates natural ventilation channels reducing heat transfer. Clay requires minimum 4:12 pitch (steeper preferred) and structural reinforcement supporting 9-12 pounds per square foot. Installation cost: $12-$18 per square foot. Best for homeowners prioritizing long-term value, energy efficiency, and authentic Southwest aesthetics. Learn more at our [link:/services/tile-roofs|tile roofing page].\n\nConcrete Tile - Value & Performance Balance: Concrete tile provides similar performance to clay at lower cost. Modern concrete tiles feature integral coloring that won't fade, lighter weight than traditional concrete (though still requiring reinforced framing), diverse color and profile options, 40-50 year lifespan, excellent fire resistance, and good energy efficiency (though less thermal mass than clay). Concrete tile works on 4:12+ pitch, costs $9-$13 per square foot installed, and provides excellent value for homeowners wanting tile aesthetics and performance at reduced investment. Concrete tile is ideal for production homes, first-time homebuyers, or properties where budget constraints preclude premium clay tile.\n\nArchitectural Shingles - Cost-Effective Reliability: Premium architectural shingles deliver reliable performance at accessible pricing. Modern shingles feature dimensional profiles mimicking tile or shake appearance, 25-35 year lifespan in Tucson (with proper ventilation), algae-resistant formulations, impact-resistant options qualifying for insurance discounts, cool roof technology with reflective granules, and lightweight installation on standard framing. Shingles work on 4:12+ pitch (2:12 minimum with special underlayment), cost $5-$9 per square foot installed, and suit budget-conscious projects, rental properties, homes requiring replacement before sale, and applications where long-term ownership isn't expected. While shingles don't last as long as tile in Tucson's intense UV radiation, proper installation and premium materials provide 25-30 years of dependable service. Explore [link:/services/shingle-roofs|shingle roofing options] for detailed information.\n\nMetal Roofing - Modern Efficiency: Standing seam metal roofing excels for contemporary pitched roof applications. Metal provides exceptional benefits: 40-60 year lifespan, maximum energy efficiency (reflects 60-70% solar radiation), zero maintenance requirements, recyclability at end of life, compatibility with solar panels via non-penetrating mounts, and sleek modern aesthetics. Metal suits 3:12+ pitch, costs $10-$16 per square foot installed, and works best for contemporary architectural styles, environmentally-conscious homeowners, properties with solar installation plans, and applications prioritizing maximum energy efficiency. Metal's lightweight (1-2 pounds per square foot) requires no structural reinforcement. Visit our [link:/services/metal-roofs|metal roofing page] for complete details.\n\nMaterial Selection Decision Matrix: We recommend considering: budget parameters (what you can afford initially vs. long-term value), expected ownership duration (staying 3-5 years vs. 20+ years), architectural style requirements (Spanish Colonial demands tile, contemporary suits metal), energy efficiency priorities (metal and clay excel, shingles adequate with cool-roof technology), structural capacity (existing framing may require reinforcement for tile), and HOA or historic district requirements (some mandate specific materials). During consultation, we provide samples of all appropriate materials, explain performance characteristics, outline costs, and help you select optimal material for your specific situation. Most Tucson homeowners investing in pitched roof replacement choose tile for premium longevity and energy savings."

            "content": "Proper attic ventilation is the single most important factor in pitched roof longevity and energy efficiency in Tucson's extreme climate. Understanding ventilation principles and options ensures your pitched roof performs optimally.\n\nWhy Ventilation is Critical in Tucson: Summer attic temperatures without adequate ventilation routinely exceed 150-160°F—hot enough to cook roofing materials from beneath. This extreme heat causes asphalt shingles to become brittle and crack prematurely (reducing 30-year shingles to 15-20 years), tile underlayment to deteriorate rapidly (causing tile roof leaks), metal roofing fasteners to loosen from thermal cycling, wood decking and framing to dry out and crack, and massive heat transfer to living spaces increasing cooling costs 20-40%. Proper ventilation reduces attic temperatures to 120-130°F through continuous airflow, extending roof life 20-30%, lowering cooling costs 15-25%, preventing moisture condensation during winter (yes, Tucson gets condensation), and eliminating premature material degradation. Investment in proper ventilation ($800-$2,500 during installation or replacement) pays back within 2-4 years through energy savings while protecting your $15,000-$35,000 roof investment.\n\nVentilation System Design Principles: Effective ventilation requires balanced intake and exhaust creating continuous airflow. Building codes require minimum 1 square foot net free area (NFA) per 150 square feet of attic floor area, balanced 50/50 between intake and exhaust. For Tucson's extreme heat, we recommend exceeding code minimums by 25-50% providing extra cooling capacity. Intake vents (typically continuous soffit vents) draw cool outside air into attic at lowest elevations. Air flows upward through attic space driven by natural convection (hot air rises). Exhaust vents (ridge vents, gable vents, or powered fans) expel hot air at highest elevations. Ventilation baffles maintain open airflow channels from soffit to ridge preventing insulation from blocking airflow. This continuous circulation prevents heat accumulation and moisture retention.\n\nRidge Vents with Soffit Intake - Optimal Solution: Ridge vents combined with continuous soffit vents provide the most effective ventilation for most pitched roof applications. Advantages include full-length ridge exhaust along entire roof peak, intake along entire roof perimeter via continuous soffit vents, maximum natural convection effectiveness (greatest height differential between intake and exhaust), no visible roof penetrations (ridge vents integrate with ridge cap), no power requirements or moving parts to fail, and quiet operation without noise. Ridge vents work on both gable and hip roofs (hip vents available for hip ridges). This system provides optimal performance for 90% of Tucson pitched roofs. Cost: $800-$1,800 installed depending on roof size. We install ridge vents on virtually all new pitched roof installations and recommend them for replacement projects.\n\nGable Vents with Soffit Intake - Good for Gable Roofs: Traditional gable vents installed at gable ends combined with soffit vents provide effective ventilation for simple gable roof configurations. Benefits include end-to-end cross-ventilation, simple installation, no ridge modification required, and cost-effectiveness ($600-$1,200 installed). However, gable vents are less efficient than ridge vents (shorter flow path, less complete attic circulation) and don't work on hip roofs (no gable ends). Gable vents suit simple gable roof designs, existing homes where ridge vent installation is impractical, and budget-conscious projects. For new installations or full replacements, ridge vents provide superior performance justifying modest cost premium.\n\nPowered Attic Fans - Supplemental Cooling: Thermostatically-controlled powered attic fans provide maximum air movement for extreme heat situations. Solar-powered models operate without electrical consumption. Benefits include maximum air exchange volume, thermostatic activation only when needed (typically 90-100°F attic temperature), supplemental cooling during peak summer heat, and suitability for large complex attics. However, powered fans require installation costs ($900-$1,800), eventual motor replacement (10-15 years), potential noise concerns, and electricity consumption (unless solar-powered). We recommend powered attic fans for: large homes with complex attic spaces, supplementing ridge/soffit ventilation on exceptionally hot west-facing roofs, applications where maximum ventilation is critical (server rooms, specialty spaces), and properties where homeowners want \"belt and suspenders\" approach combining natural and powered ventilation. Most standard residential pitched roofs achieve optimal performance with properly-designed ridge and soffit ventilation alone.\n\nVentilation Integration with Pitched Roof Installation: During pitched roof installation or replacement, we assess existing ventilation adequacy, calculate required NFA based on attic square footage and Tucson climate, design ventilation system meeting or exceeding requirements (typically 1.25-1.5x code minimum), install proper ventilation baffles maintaining airflow, integrate ventilation components with roofing materials, and verify system function before completion. Proper ventilation design and installation requires expertise—we've optimized thousands of ventilation systems throughout Tucson. Don't compromise on ventilation—the performance of your $15,000-$35,000 pitched roof depends on it.

For average 2,000 sq ft home with $2,400 annual cooling costs: Conservative savings (20% with shingle roof and basic ventilation) = $480/year = $14,400 over 30 years. Moderate savings (30% with tile roof and enhanced ventilation) = $720/year = $21,600 over 30 years. Maximum savings (40% with tile roof, radiant barrier, and comprehensive ventilation) = $960/year = $28,800 over 30 years. These savings are immediate and continue for the life of the roof. Learn more about our [link:/services/home-energy-audit|home energy audit services] to quantify your specific savings potential.\n\nHome Value Increase - Measurable Appreciation: Quality pitched roof installation returns 65-75% of cost at resale according to Remodeling Magazine's Cost vs. Value Report for Tucson. Premium tile roof installation ($30,000 cost) increases home value $19,500-$22,500. New roof also accelerates sale (homes with new roofs sell 25% faster on average) and prevents buyer credits or concessions (buyers often demand $5,000-$15,000 credits for aging roofs). In competitive Tucson real estate market, new pitched roof is significant differentiator attracting serious buyers and supporting premium pricing.\n\nInsurance Benefits - Premium Reductions: Many insurance carriers offer discounts for newer roofs: 5-10% discount for roofs less than 10 years old, additional 10-20% for impact-resistant roofing materials, and prevention of coverage exclusions or non-renewals common with roofs over 20 years old. For home with $1,800 annual insurance premium, total discounts (15-30%) save $270-$540 annually = $8,100-$16,200 over 30 years. New pitched roof installation may be required to maintain insurance coverage on homes with aging roofs—making it unavoidable expense that at least provides value through discounts.\n\nAvoided Repair and Damage Costs: Aging roofs require increasing repair frequency and cost: typical 20-year-old roof needs $800-$2,000 annual repairs, 25-year-old roof needs $1,500-$4,000 annual repairs, plus risk of catastrophic leak causing $5,000-$25,000 interior damage. New pitched roof eliminates these costs and risks for 20-30+ years (depending on material). Over 30 years, avoided repairs total $15,000-$45,000—a direct financial benefit.\n\nTotal 30-Year ROI Example (Standard Pitch Tile Roof): Initial investment: $28,000 (2,000 sq ft clay tile with comprehensive ventilation). Financial returns: Energy savings (25% reduction) $18,000, insurance premium savings (15% discount) $8,100, avoided repairs and damage $25,000, resale value increase $21,000. Total financial benefit: $72,100. Net return: $44,100 beyond initial investment = 157% total return. This doesn't account for improved comfort, peace of mind, or aesthetic enhancement.

            "content": "Several Tucson-specific factors affect pitched roof costs. Climate Requirements: Tucson's extreme heat requires enhanced ventilation (add $400-$1,200), premium high-temperature underlayment (add $300-$800), and cool roofing materials for optimal efficiency (add $0-$2,000 depending on material). These climate-appropriate upgrades prevent premature failure and deliver energy savings justifying investment. Structural Considerations: Many Tucson homes built before 2000 have framing designed for lightweight shingle roofs. Tile installation requires structural reinforcement supporting 9-12 pounds per square foot loads. Reinforcement costs $2,000-$8,000 depending on extent but enables premium tile installation providing superior long-term value. We provide engineered solutions minimizing reinforcement costs while ensuring code compliance. Monsoon Season Timing: Scheduling installation during monsoon season (July-September) increases project risk and timeline—we typically add 15-25% contingency for monsoon delays. Fall and winter installations (September-March) provide optimal conditions, faster completion, and lower risk justifying waiting for appropriate season when possible. HOA Requirements: Many Tucson neighborhoods have HOA architectural controls requiring specific materials, colors, or profiles. Compliance sometimes necessitates premium materials or custom options increasing costs 10-30%. We assist with HOA approval process and help select compliant options balancing requirements with value.

Many Tucson ranch homes built 1960s-1990s feature composition shingle roofs needing replacement. Upgrading to concrete or clay tile during replacement dramatically improves appearance, energy efficiency, and longevity while maintaining architectural appropriateness. Gable roofs are most economical for ranch applications ($8-$14 per square foot with tile), while hip roofs provide enhanced storm resistance and traditional aesthetic ($10-$16 per square foot). Ranch-style simplicity allows focus on quality materials and proper ventilation rather than complex framing—invest in premium underlayment, enhanced ventilation, and optimal pitch ensuring maximum performance."

Symptoms include extremely high cooling bills despite new HVAC systems, premature shingle deterioration (20-year shingles failing at 12-15 years), visible tile underlayment degradation during re-tile work, ceiling stains from condensation (yes, this happens in Tucson winters), excessive attic heat (160°F+ temperatures), and musty attic odors indicating moisture issues. Root causes include missing or inadequate soffit vents blocking intake airflow, no ridge vents or inadequate gable vents limiting exhaust, insulation blocking soffit-to-ridge airflow path, and insufficient net free area for extreme Tucson heat. Solutions we implement include retrofitting continuous soffit vents ensuring adequate intake, installing ridge vents providing full-length exhaust, adding ventilation baffles maintaining airflow channels, and upgrading to 1.5x code-required ventilation for Tucson climate. Ventilation upgrades cost $1,200-$3,500 depending on roof complexity but pay back within 2-4 years through energy savings while extending roof life 10-15 years.

Flashing—metal transitions at chimneys, skylights, and penetrations—prevents water intrusion at critical junctions. Common failure modes include improperly installed or deteriorated valley metal allowing water under roofing material, missing or inadequate step flashing at wall intersections, failed skylight flashing from UV degradation or improper installation, chimney counter-flashing separation from masonry, and unsealed roof penetrations (plumbing vents, electrical conduits). Warning signs include ceiling stains near valleys or chimneys, water running down interior walls during monsoons, attic water stains visible from below, and loose or separated flashing visible from ground. Solutions require complete flashing replacement using premium materials—never attempt patch repairs on failed flashing. We remove affected roofing materials, install new metal flashing using proper techniques (step flashing, counter flashing, ice and water shield), integrate flashing with underlayment creating redundant waterproofing, and reinstall roofing materials properly. Valley and flashing repairs cost $800-$3,500 depending on extent and roof material.

Signs of debris problems include water overflowing gutters during rains, visible debris accumulation in valleys or behind solar panels, water staining on exterior walls below roof edges, and sagging gutters from weight of wet debris. Solutions include professional debris removal from valleys, gutters, and roof surfaces, trimming overhanging tree branches preventing debris accumulation, installing gutter guards in appropriate applications (not always recommended for Tucson), and improving property drainage preventing water pooling near foundation. Debris removal service costs $180-$450 depending on roof size and debris accumulation. We recommend debris removal twice yearly—spring (April-May) before monsoons and fall (October-November) after deciduous trees drop leaves. Properties with significant tree coverage benefit from quarterly cleaning. Keeping valleys and gutters clean is the single most cost-effective maintenance investment preventing water damage worth thousands."

Pre-monsoon preparation includes professional roof inspection identifying vulnerable areas, valley and gutter cleaning ensuring unobstructed drainage, securing loose tiles or shingles preventing wind damage, verifying flashing integrity at all penetrations and transitions, checking that all roof penetrations are properly sealed, and ensuring ventilation systems function properly. Schedule pre-monsoon preparation in May before storms begin. During monsoon season, pitched roofs with proper slope (4:12+) excel at rapid water drainage—but only if valleys and gutters are clear. After severe storms, conduct visual inspection from ground looking for obvious damage (missing tiles, lifted shingles, damaged flashing).

Roof surface temperatures regularly exceed 165-180°F on dark shingles, 150-160°F on standard tiles, and 120-135°F on cool-colored tiles or metal. This sustained heat stresses materials and transfers enormous heat load to attic spaces. Maximizing summer performance requires ensuring adequate ventilation reducing attic temperatures 30-40°F, verifying ventilation baffles maintain soffit-to-ridge airflow, considering radiant barrier installation reducing heat transfer 40-50%, using cool roofing materials reflecting solar radiation (light-colored tiles, cool-roof shingles, metal roofing), and maintaining proper attic insulation levels (R-38 minimum for Tucson). Summer is excellent time for pitched roof replacement—long days, predictable weather (outside monsoon storms), and readily available contractors. If replacement needed, schedule for May-June or September-October avoiding peak monsoon risk while benefiting from summer working conditions. Extreme heat also accelerates material aging—UV radiation degrades organic materials (asphalt shingles, underlayment) faster in Tucson than cooler climates. This is why premium materials and proper ventilation are critical investments for Tucson pitched roofs."

Winter is actually the best season for pitched roof replacement in Tucson—comfortable working conditions for installers, minimal rain disruption, lower contractor demand potentially reducing costs 10-15%, and ability to verify waterproofing performance during winter rains. Properties in Tucson's higher elevations (Catalina Foothills, Tanque Verde) occasionally experience brief snow or ice—proper pitched roof slope (4:12+) sheds snow quickly preventing accumulation. Winter is also ideal time for indoor projects benefiting from new roof—attic insulation upgrades, ventilation improvements, and radiant barrier installation all pair well with winter roof replacement maximizing energy efficiency before summer heat returns."

We schedule installation start date convenient for you—most residential pitched roof projects begin within 2-3 weeks of contract signing (less during winter, potentially longer during peak spring/summer). Actual installation timeline depends on roof size, pitch complexity, and material: Standard gable roof shingle installation (2,000 sq ft): 2-3 days from tear-off to completion. Standard pitch tile roof installation (2,000 sq ft): 4-6 days including framing inspection, underlayment, and tile placement. Complex multi-pitch tile roof (3,000+ sq ft): 7-14 days depending on architectural complexity. Steep-pitch premium installations: Add 30-50% to standard timelines for safety requirements. We provide detailed schedule before starting and update you daily on progress. Weather (monsoons primarily) can cause delays—we never compromise quality by rushing work in poor conditions. Upon completion, we conduct quality inspection, coordinate building department final inspection, complete comprehensive cleanup, and perform detailed walkthrough explaining your new pitched roof system."
