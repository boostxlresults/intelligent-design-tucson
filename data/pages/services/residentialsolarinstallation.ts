With over 350 sunny days annually and an average of 286 days of intense sunshine, Tucson receives approximately 5.7-6.5 peak sun hours daily—among the highest solar radiation levels in the United States. This abundant sunshine means residential solar systems in Tucson produce 25-40% more electricity annually compared to systems in cloudier regions, translating to faster payback periods and higher lifetime savings."

Tucson Electric Power (TEP) rates have increased an average of 3.2% annually over the past decade, with typical residential rates now ranging from $0.11-$0.14 per kWh depending on usage tier and time of use. Solar panels lock in your energy costs for 25+ years while utility rates continue climbing, providing predictable savings that compound over time. Many Tucson homeowners reduce their electricity bills by 70-95%, saving $1,500-$2,800 annually with properly sized systems."

Our installations meet or exceed all building codes, manufacturer specifications, and industry best practices. We communicate throughout installation about progress, any discoveries affecting the project, and timeline updates. Installation sites are kept clean with daily debris removal and final site cleanup leaving your property pristine."

Round up slightly (7.5 kW) to account for panel degradation and ensure long-term production meets needs. Account for Future Needs: Consider planning major changes: EV purchase (add 3,000-4,500 kWh/year), pool installation (add 2,500-4,000 kWh/year), home additions or remodeling, retirement with increased home time, or switching from gas to electric appliances.

Additional cost: $1,500-$3,500 (covered by our [link:/services/electrical-panel-upgrades-tucson|electrical division]). Trenching for Inverter Location: If optimal inverter location requires underground conduit. Additional cost: $500-$1,200. Battery Storage Addition: 13.5 kWh battery system (like Tesla Powerwall). Additional cost: $11,000-$14,000 (qualifies for 30% tax credit). Premium Equipment Upgrades: High-efficiency panels, extended warranties, all-black aesthetics. Additional cost: $1,000-$3,500."

Even though solar typically increases home value by $15,000-$25,000, you pay no additional property taxes on this added value. This benefit continues as long as you own the home, saving hundreds of dollars annually in avoided property tax increases.

When your solar produces more than you consume, excess energy flows to the grid and your meter runs backward, creating bill credits. These credits offset electricity usage during evening hours or cloudy days. Net metering effectively turns the utility grid into a virtual battery, banking your excess production for later use. Combined with the federal tax credit and property tax exemption, total solar incentives in Arizona reduce net installation costs by 35-45%."

Solar installation costs in Tucson average $2.50-$3.50 per watt before incentives, with typical 7kW systems costing $17,500-$24,500 ($12,250-$17,150 after the 30% tax credit)."

Solar also increases home resale value by approximately $15,000-$25,000 based on multiple real estate studies. Homes with solar sell 20% faster and often at premium prices as buyers value reduced electricity costs and environmental benefits.
