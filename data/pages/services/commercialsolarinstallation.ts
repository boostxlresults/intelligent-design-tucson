Tucson Electric Power (TEP) commercial rates have increased an average of 3.5% annually over the past decade. A typical 100kW commercial solar system produces 160,000-180,000 kWh annually worth $13,000-$21,000 at current rates, with savings compounding as utility rates continue rising. Over 25 years, commercial solar installations generate $325,000-$525,000 in electricity savings—providing exceptional ROI after federal tax incentives reduce net investment by 50-70%."

            "content": "Commercial solar systems typically offset 40-100% of facility electricity costs depending on available space and energy usage. Tucson commercial electricity rates range from $0.08-$0.15 per kWh depending on rate schedule, with demand charges adding $10-$20 per kW of peak demand monthly. A 100kW commercial solar system in Tucson produces approximately 160,000-180,000 kWh annually worth $13,000-$21,000 at current rates. Over 25 years, this system generates $325,000-$525,000 in electricity savings accounting for 3-4% annual utility rate increases."

            "content": "Return on investment for Tucson commercial solar averages 200-400% over system lifetime. After federal tax incentives reduce net investment by 50-70%, most commercial solar installations achieve 4-8 year payback periods. Following payback, systems provide 17-21 years of free electricity and protection from utility rate increases. Solar also provides budget certainty—businesses can predict electricity costs decades into the future rather than facing annual rate increases averaging 3-5%. This financial predictability assists with long-term business planning and budgeting."

Demand charges are calculated based on peak 15-minute power draw each billing period—even brief equipment surges create expensive charges lasting all month. Solar production during peak demand hours reduces grid power draw, lowering demand charges. Strategic solar system design and operation can reduce demand charges 20-50%, providing substantial savings beyond kWh consumption offset."

            "content": "Peak shaving strategies maximize demand charge reduction through proper system sizing (matching peak demand periods), battery storage enabling precise demand management, and energy management systems coordinating solar production with facility loads. For example, a business with 150kW peak demand paying $15/kW demand charges faces $2,250 monthly demand charges ($27,000 annually). Solar production reducing peak demand to 100kW saves $750 monthly ($9,000 annually)—often 20-30% of total solar savings value. Combining solar with [link:/services/home-energy-upgrades-tucson|comprehensive energy management] maximizes demand charge reduction, creating overall energy cost savings exceeding standalone solar production value."
