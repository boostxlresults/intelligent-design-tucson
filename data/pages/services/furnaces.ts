When outdoor temperatures drop 40-50°F overnight and your home loses heat rapidly through single-pane windows and minimal insulation common in older Tucson construction, a reliable furnace becomes essential for comfort and protecting your plumbing from freeze damage. Even brief cold snaps can burst unprotected pipes, cause thousands in water damage, and leave families without heat during the coldest nights of the year."

The project required running a new gas line from the street, installing a gas meter, removing the old electric furnace, and installing a new 96% AFUE gas system. It wasn't cheap ($9,200 total), but between the $1,200 TEP rebate, $2,000 tax credit, and the massive energy savings, it made total sense.
