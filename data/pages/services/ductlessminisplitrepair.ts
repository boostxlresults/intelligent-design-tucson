The indoor unit was running but blowing warm air, and ice was forming on the refrigerant lines at the outdoor unit. Initial diagnosis revealed a refrigerant leak in the evaporator coil of the master bedroom unit, reducing refrigerant charge by approximately 30%. The leak had been slow and undetected for months, causing the compressor to work progressively harder. Left unrepaired, the low refrigerant condition would have damaged the compressor within weeks, requiring a $2,800-$3,500 compressor replacement or complete outdoor unit replacement costing $4,200-$5,800.",
            "solution": "Our NATE-certified ductless specialist arrived within 78 minutes and performed comprehensive diagnostics using electronic leak detection equipment and UV dye. We located a pinhole leak in the evaporator coil brazed joint caused by vibration stress and thermal expansion. We recovered remaining refrigerant per EPA protocols, repaired the leak using proper silver brazing techniques, pressure-tested the repair to 450 PSI for 24 hours, evacuated the system with vacuum pump to remove moisture, and recharged with precise refrigerant amount using manufacturer specifications and digital scales. We also inspected the other three zones, finding minor electrical connection corrosion in the living room unit which we cleaned and sealed, preventing future communication errors.

            "solution": "Our senior ductless technician performed comprehensive diagnostics and found multiple repairable issues—not a failed system requiring replacement. The compressor was fine, but the outdoor fan motor had failed (common 10-year wear item), the start capacitor was weak, drain line was completely clogged causing safety shutdown, indoor coil was severely restricted by dust (50% airflow reduction), and outdoor coil had significant cottonwood debris blocking heat transfer. We replaced the fan motor and capacitor, thoroughly cleaned both coils, cleared the drain line, and optimized refrigerant charge. We also enrolled the homeowner in our preventive maintenance plan to protect the investment. Total repair cost: $1,580 including parts, labor, and first year of maintenance plan vs. $4,800-$6,200 for replacement—saving $3,220 to $4,620 while extending system life 8-12 additional years.",

Intelligent Design actually took time to diagnose properly and found it just needed a fan motor, cleaning, and maintenance. They repaired everything for $1,580 and it's cooling better than it has in years. They were honest when they could have easily sold me an expensive new system. I saved over $3,200, and they gave me a realistic expectation that with proper maintenance, I can get another 8-10 years from this quality system. This is what honest, expert service looks like. I've already recommended them to four neighbors. - Dr. Jennifer M., Catalina Foothills",

A severely clogged filter restricts airflow by 40-60%, causing the evaporator coil to freeze and triggering safety shutdowns. Remove the filter and hold it up to light—if you can't see light through it, it's too dirty. Clean the filter with warm water and mild soap, let it dry completely (30-45 minutes), and reinstall. Also check that the air intake grilles aren't blocked by furniture, curtains, or storage items. The unit needs at least 6 inches of clearance around all air intakes for proper operation. If the unit still doesn't cool after cleaning the filter, the problem is deeper in the system."

If the outdoor unit is completely silent when indoor unit is calling for cooling, you have an electrical or communication problem requiring professional repair. Check for debris blocking the outdoor coil—cottonwood seeds, leaves, grass clippings, or dust buildup can restrict airflow by 30-50%. Ensure at least 2 feet of clearance around all sides of the outdoor unit. Remove any vegetation, storage items, or yard equipment near the unit. Use a garden hose to gently rinse the outdoor coil from inside-out (not high pressure—you can damage the fins). Never use a pressure washer. If the outdoor unit is running but excessively hot to touch or making unusual noises (grinding, squealing, rattling), shut it off immediately and call for emergency service—continuing operation may cause compressor damage."

Check if either breaker has tripped to the 'off' position. If a breaker has tripped, this indicates an electrical problem or overcurrent condition. You can attempt to reset it once by switching it fully off, then back on. If it trips again immediately or within a few minutes, do not continue resetting—you have a short circuit or failing component requiring professional diagnosis. Also verify the disconnect switch near the outdoor unit is in the 'on' position. If power is present but system doesn't run, the issue is internal electronics or controls."

If you see ice, turn the system off immediately and switch to 'Fan Only' mode to let the ice melt (this takes 2-4 hours). Do not continue running the system with ice present—this can damage the compressor.

Locate the small drain line exiting the outdoor wall near the indoor unit—you should see occasional water dripping during system operation. If there's no drip and the unit was running for 30+ minutes, the drain may be clogged. Some indoor units have a float switch that shuts down the system when the drain pan fills with water (a safety feature preventing wall damage). If you see water backing up, turn off the system immediately. You can attempt to clear a drain clog by locating the drain line end point (usually near the outdoor unit) and using a wet/dry vacuum to suction out the clog.

New equivalent system costs $4,500 installed. Repair Path: $1,200 immediate cost provides an estimated 8-12 years additional service life (industry data shows well-maintained mini splits last 18-22 years). Average annual operating cost: $420 electricity (based on Tucson Electric Power rates and 2,500 hours annual runtime at current SEER 18 efficiency).

However, if the system needed a $3,200 compressor replacement instead, the math changes significantly—repair would cost $3,200 + $4,200 electricity = $7,400 total, making replacement the better value for the efficiency gains alone."

Example: 13-year-old SEER 13 system requiring $1,800 repair. Current electricity cost: $680 annually (2,500 hours runtime, TEP rates). New SEER 25 system costs $4,800 installed with annual electricity cost of only $350—saving $330 yearly. Over 15-year expected lifespan, total savings: $330 × 15 years = $4,950 in energy costs alone, essentially paying for the new system while delivering superior comfort, reliability, and warranty protection.
