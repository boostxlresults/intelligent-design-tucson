Cost: $35,000-85,000 for 3-system solution in 5,000+ sq ft estate. Hybrid Approach: Combination of ducted systems for main living areas and ductless mini-splits for specialty spaces, ducted zones for bedrooms and main areas (4-6 zones), ductless systems for wine cellars, home theaters, workshops, guest casitas, provides ultimate flexibility and independent control, common in luxury custom homes and estates.
