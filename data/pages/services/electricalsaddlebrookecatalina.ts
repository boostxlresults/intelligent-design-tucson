Their home, built in 2002, had a 150-amp electrical panel that was now serving far more electrical load than originally planned. They had added a second AC unit for better temperature control in their master suite, installed a golf cart charger in their garage, upgraded to modern kitchen appliances, and wanted to add landscape lighting around their front entry. The frequent breaker trips were disruptive, and they worried about electrical safety as they aged in their home.

The complete electrical upgrade cost $6,200—an investment that enhanced safety, comfort, and home value. They particularly appreciated our patient explanations and the detailed written estimate they could review before making decisions. Six months later, their electric bills are noticeably lower and they've referred three neighbors who were also dealing with aging electrical systems."
