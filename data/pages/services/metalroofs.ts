Light-colored metal roofs with reflective coatings reflect 60-80% of solar radiation versus only 20-30% for dark asphalt shingles. This dramatic difference reduces roof surface temperatures by 50-70°F—from 180-195°F for asphalt to 130-140°F for cool metal roofing. The temperature reduction translates directly to attic temperature reductions of 20-35°F, cutting cooling loads by 20-30% and reducing summer electricity costs by $300-$800 annually for typical Tucson homes. Metal's low thermal mass means it heats quickly but also cools rapidly after sunset, unlike [link:/services/tile-roofs|tile roofing] or asphalt which retain heat for hours."

We evaluate roof pitch to determine suitable metal roofing systems (standing seam works on 2:12+, corrugated requires 3:12+). Existing roof structure is assessed for adequate support—metal roofing's light weight (1-3 lbs/sq ft) rarely requires reinforcement unlike [link:/services/tile-roofs|heavy tile roofing].

Cost: $0.75-$1.50 per sq ft. Recommended for: Premium installations maximizing energy performance, homes with occupied attic spaces or cathedral ceilings, commercial applications with minimal insulation."
