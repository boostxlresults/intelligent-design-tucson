Solar installations, high-efficiency HVAC systems, and certain electrical upgrades often qualify for significant incentives."
    },

      question: "Can I pay off my financing early without penalty?",

  serviceName: 'Warranties & Guarantees',
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What warranties do you offer on your work?",
      answer: "We stand behind every job with comprehensive warranties. Our repairs include workmanship guarantees, and our installations come with both manufacturer warranties on equipment (typically 5-10 years on parts, 10+ years on compressors) and our own installation workmanship warranty. If it's not right, we'll make it right—guaranteed."
    },
    {
      question: "How long are your workmanship warranties?",
      answer: "Our workmanship warranties vary by service type. Most repairs include a minimum 1-year workmanship guarantee, while new installations typically include 1-2 year workmanship warranties. Extended warranty options are available for additional peace of mind on major installations like HVAC systems, water heaters, and electrical panels."
    },
    {
      question: "What does your 100% satisfaction guarantee cover?",
      answer: "Our 100% satisfaction guarantee means we're not done until you're completely happy with our work. If you're not satisfied with our service, we'll work with you to make it right. This includes re-service if needed, addressing any concerns, and ensuring the job meets our high standards and your expectations."
    },
    {
      question: "Are parts covered under warranty?",
      answer: "Yes! Parts are covered under manufacturer warranties, which vary by brand and equipment type. Most HVAC parts have 5-10 year coverage, compressors often have 10+ year warranties, and water heater tanks typically have 6-12 year warranties. We help you navigate warranty claims and ensure you get full coverage benefits."
    },
    {
      question: "What if something breaks shortly after you fix it?",
      answer: "If a repair fails within the warranty period, we'll return to fix it at no additional charge. Our workmanship warranties cover the specific repair performed, so if the same issue recurs, we take care of it. We stand behind our work and want you to have complete confidence in our repairs."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer extended warranty options?",
      answer: "Yes, extended warranty options are available for major equipment installations like HVAC systems, water heaters, and generators. Extended warranties provide additional years of coverage beyond standard manufacturer warranties, protecting your investment and providing long-term peace of mind. Ask about extended warranty options during your estimate."
    },
    {
      question: "What's not covered under your warranties?",
      answer: "Warranties typically don't cover damage from misuse, lack of maintenance, natural disasters, or repairs performed by other companies. Normal wear and tear on consumable items (like air filters) isn't covered. We provide clear warranty terms in writing so you understand exactly what's covered and for how long."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I file a warranty claim?",
      answer: "Filing a warranty claim is easy—just call us! If you experience an issue with equipment or work we performed, contact our office and we'll schedule a service call. We handle all warranty documentation and, if needed, work directly with manufacturers on your behalf to process claims efficiently."
    },
    {
      question: "Do preventive maintenance plans include warranty benefits?",
      answer: "Yes! Our Family Protection Plan members receive priority service, repair discounts, and enhanced warranty coverage. Regular maintenance also helps preserve manufacturer warranties, as many require proof of annual service. Maintenance plan members get preferred pricing on repairs and priority scheduling."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if you go out of business?",
      answer: "We've been serving Tucson since 1979—over 45 years—and aren't going anywhere! We're a stable, family-owned, BBB A+ rated company with deep roots in this community. Manufacturer warranties on equipment remain valid regardless and can be serviced by any qualified contractor. Your investment is protected."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your technicians licensed and insured?",
      answer: "Absolutely! All our technicians hold valid Arizona contractor licenses (ROC 340962, 322375, 296386, 276673) and we maintain comprehensive liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage. This protects you and ensures all work meets Arizona code requirements. We're fully bonded and insured for your protection and peace of mind."

export const familyProtectionPlansFAQs: ServiceFAQs = {
  serviceId: 'family-protection-plans',
  serviceName: 'Family Protection Plans',
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is the Family Protection Plan?",
      answer: "Our Family Protection Plan is a comprehensive preventive maintenance program that covers your home's major systems—HVAC, plumbing, and electrical. Members receive scheduled tune-ups, priority service, repair discounts, and no overtime charges on emergency calls. It's like an insurance policy for your home's comfort and safety systems."
    },
    {
      question: "What services are included in the Family Protection Plan?",
      answer: "Plans include twice-yearly HVAC tune-ups (spring AC service, fall heating service), annual plumbing inspections with water heater flush, annual electrical safety inspection, priority scheduling for all service calls, 15% discount on all repairs, and no overtime charges on emergency calls. You also get first access to special promotions and seasonal offers."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the Family Protection Plan cost?",
      answer: "Family Protection Plan pricing depends on which systems you want covered and your home's size. Basic plans start around $299/year for HVAC-only coverage, while comprehensive plans covering HVAC, plumbing, and electrical run $499-699/year. Compare this to the cost of individual service calls and emergency repairs—most members save money in the first year alone."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my Family Protection Plan?",
      answer: "Yes, you can cancel your plan at any time with 30 days' notice. We offer no-risk satisfaction guarantees on our plans. If you're not completely satisfied with the value and service, you can cancel. Most members renew year after year because the savings and benefits far exceed the cost."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a maintenance plan and a home warranty?",
      answer: "Our maintenance plan focuses on prevention—regular tune-ups and inspections prevent breakdowns and extend equipment life. Home warranties cover repairs when things break. Our plan offers repair discounts and priority service but isn't insurance. Think of it as proactive protection versus reactive coverage. Many members have both."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I get priority service as a Family Protection Plan member?",
      answer: "Yes! Members get priority scheduling ahead of non-members, especially important during peak season when AC demand is highest. You'll also get no-overtime charges on emergency calls—even nights, weekends, and holidays. Priority service means faster response when you need us most."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I save with the plan's repair discount?",
      answer: "Members save 15% on all repairs, which can add up to hundreds or thousands of dollars on major repairs. One AC compressor replacement or water heater installation could save you more than the annual plan cost. Plus, regular maintenance prevents many expensive repairs entirely, saving even more."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade my plan to include additional systems?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You can upgrade your plan anytime to add coverage for additional systems. Start with HVAC coverage and add plumbing or electrical later. We'll prorate the cost based on your renewal date. Many members start with basic coverage and expand as they see the value."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I move?",
      answer: "If you sell your home, your Family Protection Plan can transfer to the new owner, which can be a valuable selling point. Alternatively, you can transfer your plan to your new home if we service that area. We work with you to ensure your investment isn't lost and you stay protected."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any hidden fees or charges?",
      answer: "No! The plan price is all-inclusive—no trip charges, no diagnostic fees, no hidden costs. You know exactly what you're paying upfront. If repairs are needed beyond the included maintenance, you'll get transparent pricing with your 15% member discount before any work begins. No surprises."
    },
    {
      question: "How do Family Protection Plans prevent expensive repairs?",
      answer: "Regular maintenance catches small issues before they become expensive emergencies. Clean coils improve efficiency and prevent compressor failure. Flushed water heaters last years longer. Inspected electrical connections prevent dangerous failures. In Tucson's extreme climate, preventive care is essential—and our members enjoy better reliability, lower energy bills, and fewer expensive surprises."
