## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

Each service data file (`data/pages/services/[slug].ts`) should follow this structure:

```typescript
export const [slug]Data: ServicePageData = {
  // ... existing SEO & meta ...
  
  content: {
    mainHeading: '[Service Name]',
    sections: [
      // ... existing sections ...
      
      // ADD NEW SECTIONS HERE:
      
      {
        "type": "heading",
        "heading": "[Cost Section Heading]",
        "level": 2
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "content": "[Cost content with \\n for line breaks]"
      },
      
      // ... more cost subsections (H3) ...
      
      {
        "type": "heading",
        "heading": "Seasonal Maintenance Guide for Tucson",
        "level": 2
      },
      // ... seasonal content sections ...
      
      {
        "type": "heading",
        "heading": "Troubleshooting & When to Call a Pro",
        "level": 2
      },
      // ... troubleshooting sections ...
      
      {
        "type": "heading",

      },
      {

        "content": "[Final CTA with phone number and trust signals]"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  // ... existing faqs, commonQuestions ...
};
```

### Content Formatting

**CRITICAL: All paragraph content MUST use proper markdown syntax.**

The ServicePage component uses a RichText parser that converts markdown to HTML. Without markdown, content renders as plain text with no formatting.

**Paragraph Content (MUST use markdown):**
- `**bold text**` → Renders as `<strong>` tags for emphasis
- `\n\n` → Creates paragraph breaks with spacing
- `\n` → Creates line breaks within paragraphs
- `- Item\n- Item` → Renders as `<ul><li>` bullet lists
- `**Label:** Value` → Bold labels followed by values (e.g., costs)

**Heading Levels:**
- H2 (`level: 2`) for major sections
- H3 (`level: 3`) for subsections

**Why Markdown Matters:**
The RichText component parses markdown into HTML. Without proper markdown syntax, your content will render as plain text with no formatting, poor readability, and terrible UX.

---

### Critical: Markdown Formatting Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** All paragraph content MUST use proper markdown syntax to render correctly. The ServicePage component uses a RichText parser that converts markdown to HTML.

#### Required Markdown Syntax

**Bold Text:**
```
**Most Common Repairs:** $300-$600
```
Renders as: **Most Common Repairs:** $300-$600 (with strong emphasis)

**Bullet Lists:**
```
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
```
Renders as proper `<ul>` with `<li>` items

**Paragraph Breaks:**
```
First paragraph.\n\nSecond paragraph.
```
Creates separate `<p>` tags with spacing

**Line Breaks Within Paragraphs:**
```
Line one\nLine two
```
Creates `<br>` tags

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**WRONG - Plain Text:**
```typescript
{
  type: "paragraph",
  content: "Most Common Repairs: $300-$600\nOverall Range: $150-$900"
}
```
Result: All text runs together, no bold emphasis, poor scannability

**CORRECT - Markdown Syntax:**
```typescript
{
  type: "paragraph",
  content: "**Most Common Repairs:** $300-$600\n**Overall Range:** $150-$900\n\nSeveral factors influence your final cost..."
}
```
Result: Bold headings, proper line breaks, scannable format

#### Testing Your Content

After adding content, verify formatting by:
1. Navigate to the service page in browser
2. Check that bold text renders as `<strong>` tags (darker, heavier weight)
3. Verify bullet lists display with actual bullets (not dashes)
4. Confirm paragraph breaks create visual separation
5. Ensure content is scannable, not a wall of text

**Reference Example:** See `data/pages/services/acrepair.ts` for gold-standard markdown formatting throughout all sections.
